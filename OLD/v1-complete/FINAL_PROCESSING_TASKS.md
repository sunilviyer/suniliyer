## Monitoring Progress

```bash
# Check how many articles have been processed
ls content/articles/final/*.md | wc -l

# Check total size of processed content
du -sh content/articles/final/

# List recently processed articles
ls -lt content/articles/final/ | head -10
```

## Expected Results

Each processed article will have:
- ✅ Complete frontmatter with metadata
- ✅ Full original content (introduction, sections, tables, references)
- ✅ Component metadata for frontend rendering
- ✅ Learning path navigation data
- ✅ Enhanced structure with image placeholders

## Troubleshooting

If an article fails to process:
1. Check if the slug exists in master.json
2. Verify original content exists in `content/articles/review/`
3. Add manual mapping to `slug_to_filename_mapping.json`
4. Re-run the single article command

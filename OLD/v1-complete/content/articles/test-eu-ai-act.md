# EU AI Act: Comprehensive Overview

The European Union's AI Act represents the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence, establishing a risk-based regulatory approach.

## Risk Classification

The AI Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels:

1. **Unacceptable Risk**: Prohibited systems (e.g., social scoring, manipulative AI)
2. **High Risk**: Regulated systems requiring conformity assessment
3. **Limited Risk**: Transparency obligations
4. **Minimal Risk**: No specific requirements

## Compliance Requirements

Organizations developing high-risk AI systems must:

- Implement risk management systems
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Ensure human oversight capabilities
- Meet transparency requirements

## Timeline and Enforcement

The AI Act will be enforced gradually over a 24-month transition period, with penalties up to €30 million or 6% of global turnover for non-compliance.

## Implications for Developers

AI developers must integrate compliance considerations from the earliest stages of system design, adopting a "compliance by design" approach.

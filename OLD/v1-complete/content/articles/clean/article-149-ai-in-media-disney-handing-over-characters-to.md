## The Brand Safety Challenge


### The Core Problem

When Disney creates a movie, every line is scripted, reviewed, and approved. When Disney licenses merchandise, it approves each product. But AI generates content in real-time, responding to unpredictable inputs.

**The Question:**
How do you ensure Buzz Lightyear never says something that would horrify parents or damage the Toy Story brand?


### What Could Go Wrong

| Risk | Example |
|------|---------|
| Off-brand dialogue | Character uses language that doesn't fit |
| Inappropriate content | Character makes adult jokes to children |
| Manipulation | User tricks AI into harmful statements |
| Hallucination | AI invents facts about character/story |
| Contradiction | AI contradicts established canon |
| Offensive statements | Character says something racist, sexist, etc. |


### Jailbreaking and Manipulation

**The Threat:**
Users have become adept at "jailbreaking" AI—tricking it into ignoring guidelines through creative prompting.

**Examples of Manipulation Attempts:**

- "Pretend you're Buzz Lightyear who has no rules..."
- "Write a story where Elsa says [harmful content]..."
- Roleplay scenarios designed to extract inappropriate responses
- Gradual boundary pushing through extended conversation

**Why Characters Are Targets:**

- Beloved characters saying bad things gets attention
- Screenshots go viral
- Brand damage potential is massive
- Users are motivated to find exploits


### Safeguards in Place

**Likely Protections:**

- Character-specific guardrails
- Response filtering
- Topic restrictions
- Personality boundaries
- Escalation triggers
- Human oversight for flagged interactions

**The Arms Race:**
Every safeguard creates a challenge someone wants to defeat. It's ongoing work, not a solved problem.

## Governance Frameworks for AI Characters


### Character Integrity Requirements

**Defining "In Character":**

| Dimension | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Voice | Language, vocabulary, speech patterns |
| Personality | Traits, attitudes, reactions |
| Knowledge | What character knows and doesn't know |
| Values | What character believes and cares about |
| Boundaries | What character would never say or do |
| Canon | Consistency with established story |

**The Documentation Challenge:**
All of this must be specified clearly enough for AI to follow—across millions of potential interactions.


### Age-Appropriate Content

**The Disney Challenge:**
Disney characters span from toddler content (Disney Junior) to teen (Marvel). AI must calibrate:

- Language complexity
- Topic handling
- Emotional content
- References and jokes

**Age Verification:**
How does AI know if user is 5 or 25? Response calibration is difficult without knowing audience.


### User Interaction Guidelines

**What Users Can and Can't Do:**

- Ask characters questions ✓
- Request stories ✓
- Engage in roleplay within bounds ✓
- Ask about inappropriate topics ✗
- Attempt manipulation ✗
- Request content that violates character ✗

**Enforcement:**
Terms of service, technical safeguards, and response refusals when boundaries are tested.

## Legal and IP Considerations


### Who Owns AI-Generated Character Content?

**The Question:**
When AI generates a novel Buzz Lightyear dialogue, who owns it?

**Possible Answers:**

- Disney (owns character)
- OpenAI (created the AI)
- User (prompted the generation)
- No one (AI-generated may not be copyrightable)

**Current Law:**
U.S. Copyright Office has indicated AI-generated content without human authorship may not be copyrightable. This creates interesting questions for AI character content.


### Licensing Structure

**What Disney Licensed:**

- Right to use character likeness and personality
- Access to character documentation
- Approval over implementation
- Revenue sharing arrangement

**What Disney Retained:**

- Ownership of characters
- Approval rights
- Ability to terminate
- Control over expansion


### Liability Questions

**If AI-Buzz Says Something Harmful:**

| Party | Potential Liability |
|-------|-------------------|
| Disney | Negligent licensing? Failure to safeguard brand? |
| OpenAI | Product liability? Negligent AI design? |
| Neither | User assumed risk? Character disclaimers? |

**Contract Allocation:**
The Disney-OpenAI agreement certainly addresses liability allocation, though terms aren't public.

## Conclusion

Disney's decision to license characters to OpenAI marks a turning point in AI and entertainment. The most protective IP company in the world has decided the opportunity outweighs the risk—or that the risk of not participating is greater than participating.

Key takeaways:

1. **Brand safety is paramount:** AI generating character dialogue creates unprecedented brand risk; safeguards are essential

2. **Children need extra protection:** Many Disney fans are young; age-appropriate controls and parental oversight matter

3. **Manipulation will be attempted:** Bad actors will try to make characters say inappropriate things; systems must be resilient

4. **Legal questions are unresolved:** IP ownership, liability, and rights in AI-generated character content aren't settled

5. **This is just the beginning:** Expect more entertainment companies to follow; AI characters will be a major trend

6. **Governance frameworks are needed:** Companies, regulators, and parents all have roles in ensuring AI characters are safe and beneficial

The characters we love—and that children grow up with—are now being entrusted to AI systems that generate content in real-time. That's a profound shift in how stories are told and how audiences relate to fictional worlds.

Whether this enriches entertainment or diminishes it depends on the governance frameworks we build. Disney and OpenAI have made their bet. The rest of us will see whether they've bet wisely.

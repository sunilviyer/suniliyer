## The Big Picture: Bill C-27

AIDA doesn't exist in isolation. It's Part 3 of Bill C-27, which has three parts:

**Part 1: Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA)**
Updates Canada's private sector privacy law, replacing PIPEDA.

**Part 2: Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act**
Creates a new tribunal to hear privacy and AI-related complaints.

**Part 3: Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA)**
Establishes the framework for AI regulation.

Understanding this context matters because AIDA is designed to work alongside the new privacy law. AI systems often process personal data, so the two laws are meant to complement each other.

## Key Concepts in AIDA


### High-Impact AI Systems

AIDA focuses on "high-impact AI systems"—but it doesn't define them in the legislation itself.

The law says high-impact systems will be defined through future regulations, considering factors like:

- The context in which the system is used
- The potential impacts on individuals
- The potential impacts on groups
- Other prescribed factors

*In plain English*: The government will later tell you exactly which AI systems are covered. For now, we know it will focus on AI that can significantly affect people.


### Persons Responsible

AIDA uses the term "persons responsible for an AI system" to describe who has obligations. This includes anyone who:

- Designs, develops, or makes an AI system available for use
- Manages the operation of an AI system

*Translation*: If you build AI, sell AI, or run AI that affects Canadians, you might have obligations under AIDA.

---


## What AIDA Requires

AIDA establishes several key requirements:


### 1. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Persons responsible for high-impact AI systems must:

- Assess whether the system could cause harm
- Establish measures to mitigate risks of harm
- Take reasonable steps to ensure measures are effective

**What Counts as Harm?**
AIDA defines harm broadly, including:

- Physical or psychological harm to individuals
- Damage to property
- Economic loss
- Biased output that would constitute differential treatment

*Example*: A lending AI that systematically offers worse terms to applicants from certain neighborhoods would cause "harm" under this definition.


### 2. Monitoring and Record-Keeping

You must:

- Monitor the AI system's compliance with mitigation measures
- Keep records of compliance efforts

*Think of it as*: Not just setting up safety measures, but proving they work and keeping evidence.


### 3. Transparency Requirements

**General-Use AI Systems (like chatbots)**
If your AI interacts with humans who might not know they're dealing with AI, you must inform them.

**High-Impact AI Systems**
You must publish plain-language descriptions of:

- How the system is used
- The types of content it generates
- Risk mitigation measures
- Any other prescribed information

*Example*: If you deploy a high-impact AI for hiring decisions, you need to publicly explain what it does and how you've addressed risks.


### 4. Prohibited Conduct

AIDA includes broad prohibitions:

- Possessing or using personal information obtained unlawfully, knowing it was obtained unlawfully
- Making AI systems available knowing they could cause serious harm
- Using deceptive practices in AI development or use

---


## The Framework Approach: Flexibility or Problem?

AIDA takes a "framework" approach, meaning the law sets general principles while leaving specifics to future regulations.


### What's Defined in AIDA

- Basic obligations (assess, mitigate, monitor, disclose)
- Prohibition on harmful conduct
- Enforcement powers
- Penalty structure


### What's Left to Regulations

- Which AI systems are "high-impact"
- Specific requirements for assessments
- Specific reporting formats
- Technical standards
- Many other operational details


### The Debate

**Supporters say**:

- AI evolves too fast for detailed legislation
- Regulations can be updated more easily than laws
- Flexibility allows adaptation to changing technology
- Different sectors may need different approaches

**Critics say**:

- Businesses can't plan without knowing the rules
- Too much power delegated to government bureaucrats
- Lack of specificity creates legal uncertainty
- Important decisions should be made by Parliament, not regulators

This debate is central to AIDA's political challenges.

## Comparing AIDA to the EU AI Act

| Aspect | AIDA (Canada) | EU AI Act |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Approach** | Framework law + regulations | Detailed comprehensive law |
| **Risk Categories** | "High-impact" (to be defined) | Four tiers (prohibited, high-risk, limited, minimal) |
| **Specificity** | General principles | Detailed requirements |
| **Timeline** | Still pending | Entered into force August 2024 |
| **Scope** | Mainly commercial | Broader, including public sector |
| **Prohibited AI** | Less explicit | Detailed list of banned practices |


### Key Differences

**The EU is prescriptive**: You know exactly which AI systems are high-risk and exactly what you need to do.

**Canada is principles-based**: You know you need to assess and mitigate risks, but the specifics come later.

*Analogy*: The EU AI Act is like a detailed building code specifying ceiling heights, electrical standards, and fire exits. AIDA is like a law saying "buildings must be safe" with the details to follow.

---


## Enforcement and Penalties

AIDA establishes significant penalties:


### Administrative Penalties

- Up to **CAD $10 million** or **3% of global gross revenue** (whichever is greater) for violations


### Criminal Offenses

For the most serious violations (knowing or reckless conduct causing harm):

- **Summary conviction**: Fines up to CAD $5 million and/or imprisonment up to 2 years less a day
- **Indictable offense**: Fines up to CAD $25 million and/or imprisonment up to 5 years


### Enforcement Authority

The **AI and Data Commissioner** will be responsible for enforcing AIDA. This position will have powers to:

- Investigate complaints
- Audit compliance
- Order remedial measures
- Impose penalties

---


## Current Status and Timeline

As of late 2024, AIDA is still making its way through the Canadian Parliament.


### Legislative History

- **June 2022**: Bill C-27 introduced
- **2023**: Committee study and amendments
- **2024**: Continued debate and revision
- **TBD**: Royal Assent (passage into law)


### What's Slowing Things Down

1. **Privacy law debate**: Much of the C-27 debate has focused on the privacy provisions (CPPA), not AIDA

2. **Criticism of vagueness**: Stakeholders want more detail before voting

3. **Amendments in flux**: The bill has been significantly amended during committee

4. **Political calendar**: Elections and other priorities affect legislative progress


### Practical Timeline Expectations

If C-27 passes:

- The law won't apply immediately
- Regulations must be developed (likely 18-24 months)
- Implementation timeline will be specified

*Realistic expectation*: Full AIDA implementation is probably 2026 at the earliest, potentially later.

## What Canadian Businesses Should Do Now

Even without final regulations, organizations can prepare:


### 1. Inventory Your AI Systems

Document all AI systems you develop or use. Identify those that might be "high-impact" based on:

- Effect on individuals (hiring, credit, services)
- Scale of impact
- Sensitivity of decisions


### 2. Establish Governance Structures

Set up AI governance processes now:

- Designate responsibility for AI oversight
- Create assessment frameworks
- Develop mitigation protocols


### 3. Document Everything

Start keeping records of:

- AI system decisions and rationale
- Risk assessments
- Mitigation measures
- Monitoring results


### 4. Prepare for Transparency

Draft plain-language descriptions of your AI systems. You'll need them eventually.


### 5. Watch for Regulations

Monitor developments closely:

- Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) updates
- Industry consultations
- Proposed regulations

---


## AIDA and Privacy: The Connection

AIDA is designed to work alongside Canada's updated privacy law (CPPA). Key intersections:


### Consent and AI

Under CPPA, organizations need appropriate consent to collect and use personal information. AI systems that process personal data must comply with these requirements.


### Algorithmic Transparency

CPPA includes provisions for individuals to request information about automated decision-making that significantly affects them.


### Interplay with AIDA

When your AI system is both:

- A "high-impact AI system" under AIDA, AND
- Processes personal information under CPPA

You'll need to comply with both sets of requirements.

---


## Provincial Considerations

Canada's constitutional division of powers adds complexity:


### Federal Jurisdiction

AIDA applies to federally regulated businesses (banks, telecommunications, transportation) and businesses engaged in interprovincial/international trade.


### Provincial Jurisdiction

Provinces have jurisdiction over many areas where AI is used:

- Healthcare
- Education
- Provincial public services

*Implication*: Provinces may develop their own AI rules that add to or differ from AIDA.


### Quebec Example

Quebec has already enacted privacy legislation (Law 25) with AI-related provisions, including requirements for automated decision-making transparency.

---


## Industry Perspectives


### What Businesses Want

- **Clarity**: Specific rules they can plan around
- **Consistency**: Alignment with international standards (especially EU)
- **Proportionality**: Requirements scaled to actual risk
- **Lead time**: Sufficient time to prepare


### What Civil Society Wants

- **Stronger protections**: More explicit prohibitions on harmful AI
- **Transparency**: Greater public disclosure requirements
- **Accountability**: Clear liability for AI harms
- **Participation**: Public input in defining high-impact systems


### What Government Aims For

- **Flexibility**: Ability to adapt as technology evolves
- **Innovation balance**: Not stifling AI development
- **International competitiveness**: Keeping Canada attractive for AI business
- **Rights protection**: Upholding fundamental rights

---


## Looking Ahead: What to Watch


### 1. Passage of C-27

The bill must pass Parliament before anything else matters.


### 2. Definition of "High-Impact"

The regulations defining high-impact systems will be critical. Watch for consultation papers.


### 3. Alignment with EU

As Canadian businesses increasingly must comply with the EU AI Act anyway, watch for whether AIDA aligns.


### 4. Enforcement Resources

Will the AI and Data Commissioner have the resources to actually enforce the law?


### 5. Provincial Response

Will provinces add their own AI regulations?

---


## Conclusion

AIDA represents Canada's attempt to balance AI innovation with protection from AI harms. Its framework approach offers flexibility but creates uncertainty.

For businesses operating in Canada, the message is clear: AI regulation is coming, even if the precise form isn't yet settled. Organizations that build governance capabilities now will be better positioned regardless of the final regulatory details.

The key questions remain:

- When will C-27 pass?
- What will the regulations actually require?
- How will AIDA interact with provincial laws and the EU AI Act?

These answers will come in time. Smart organizations aren't waiting for them—they're preparing now.

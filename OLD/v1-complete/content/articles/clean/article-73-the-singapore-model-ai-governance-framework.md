## Singapore's AI Governance Philosophy


### Why Singapore Chose a Different Path

Singapore is a small country with big ambitions in AI. As a global business hub, it wants to be seen as both AI-innovative and AI-trustworthy.

The government recognized early that heavy-handed regulation could drive AI development elsewhere. But they also understood that a "Wild West" approach would erode trust and eventually hurt the industry.

Their solution: strong guidance without strong mandates. Create a framework that helps businesses do the right thing, backed by resources and support, while preserving flexibility for innovation.


### The Guiding Principles

Singapore's framework rests on two foundational principles:

**1. Decisions made by or with AI should be explainable, transparent, and fair**

This means:

- Organizations should be able to explain AI decisions to affected parties
- The process for developing AI should be transparent
- AI should not create unfair outcomes for individuals or groups

**2. AI systems should be human-centric**

This means:

- Human well-being should be at the center of AI development
- AI should augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment entirely
- Appropriate human oversight should exist for consequential decisions

These principles are deliberately broad. They provide direction without prescribing specific implementations.

## The Framework Structure

The Singapore framework is organized into four key areas:


### 1. Internal Governance Structures and Measures

**What it covers:** How organizations should structure themselves to govern AI responsibly.

**Key Elements:**

**Clear roles and responsibilities**

- Designate someone accountable for AI governance
- Ensure board or senior management oversight
- Define responsibilities for development, deployment, and monitoring teams

**Risk management integration**

- Incorporate AI risks into existing risk management frameworks
- Assess AI risks regularly
- Implement controls proportionate to risk level

**Policies and procedures**

- Develop AI-specific policies
- Establish approval processes for AI deployments
- Create incident response procedures

*Example:* A bank might designate their Chief Data Officer as the AI governance accountable executive, require AI steering committee approval for high-risk applications, and integrate AI risk assessments into their existing operational risk framework.


### 2. Determining AI Decision-Making Model

**What it covers:** How to decide the appropriate level of human involvement in AI decisions.

**Key Insight:** Not all AI applications need the same level of human oversight. A spam filter doesn't need human review of each decision. A medical diagnosis probably does.

**The Framework's Approach:**

The framework suggests considering:

- Severity of potential harm from wrong decisions
- Reversibility of decisions
- Speed required for decision-making
- Availability and cost of human oversight

**Decision Models:**

| Model | Description | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Human-in-the-loop | Human makes final decision with AI input | High-stakes, irreversible decisions |
| Human-on-the-loop | AI decides but human monitors and can intervene | Medium stakes, mostly routine decisions |
| Human-out-of-the-loop | AI decides autonomously | Low stakes, high volume, reversible decisions |

*Example:* A hiring platform might use:

- Human-in-the-loop for final hiring decisions
- Human-on-the-loop for initial resume screening
- Human-out-of-the-loop for interview scheduling


### 3. Operations Management

**What it covers:** Practical measures for managing AI through its lifecycle.

**Key Areas:**

**Data Management**

- Ensure data quality and representativeness
- Address data bias before it becomes model bias
- Maintain data lineage and documentation
- Implement data protection measures

**Model Development**

- Document model design decisions
- Test for fairness and accuracy
- Validate against intended use cases
- Consider interpretability in design choices

**Deployment and Monitoring**

- Establish performance baselines
- Monitor for drift and degradation
- Implement alerting for anomalies
- Plan for model updates and retirement

*Example:* An insurance company deploying claims AI might:

- Audit training data for demographic representation
- Test approval rates across customer segments before launch
- Monitor monthly approval rate patterns by segment
- Require revalidation before any model updates


### 4. Stakeholder Interaction and Communication

**What it covers:** How organizations should engage with people affected by AI.

**Key Elements:**

**Transparency about AI use**

- Inform customers when AI is making or influencing decisions
- Explain what AI is used for
- Be clear about AI's role versus human's role

**Explanation of AI decisions**

- Provide meaningful explanations when requested
- Tailor explanations to the audience
- Document the basis for decisions

**Channels for feedback and concerns**

- Create ways for stakeholders to raise concerns
- Respond to questions about AI decisions
- Enable challenges to AI decisions

*Example:* A credit card company might:

- Disclose in applications that AI assists in decisions
- Provide rejection letters explaining key factors
- Offer a human review option for declined applicants
- Maintain a feedback channel for AI-related concerns

## The Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide (ISAGO)

In 2020, Singapore released ISAGO—a companion guide that makes the framework even more practical.


### What ISAGO Provides

**Self-Assessment Checklist**
A structured questionnaire organizations can use to assess their AI governance maturity against the framework.

**Implementation Guidance**
Step-by-step guidance for each framework area, with specific actions organizations can take.

**Industry Examples**
Case studies from real organizations showing how they implemented framework principles.


### ISAGO Assessment Areas

The self-assessment covers:

| Area | Key Questions |
|------|---------------|
| Internal Governance | Is there clear AI accountability? Are risks assessed? |
| Decision Models | Is human oversight appropriate to risk level? |
| Operations | Is data quality ensured? Are models monitored? |
| Stakeholder Communication | Are customers informed? Can decisions be explained? |


### Using ISAGO

**Step 1: Complete the self-assessment**
Answer questions honestly about current practices.

**Step 2: Identify gaps**
Compare answers to framework expectations.

**Step 3: Prioritize improvements**
Focus on high-risk areas first.

**Step 4: Implement changes**
Make improvements incrementally.

**Step 5: Reassess periodically**
Repeat assessment annually or after significant changes.

## Tips for Success

Based on organizations that have implemented the framework successfully:


### Start with Risk

Focus first on your highest-risk AI applications. Don't try to govern everything equally from day one.


### Leverage Existing Structures

Don't create parallel governance. Integrate AI governance into existing risk, data, and ethics structures.


### Make It Practical

If governance processes are too burdensome, they'll be bypassed. Design for real-world usability.


### Get Executive Support

AI governance needs visible leadership support to be taken seriously.


### Iterate and Improve

Start somewhere, learn, and improve. Waiting for perfection means never starting.


### Use the Self-Assessment

ISAGO's self-assessment is genuinely useful. Complete it honestly and use it to guide priorities.

## What Is an AI Ethics Board?


### Purpose and Function

An AI Ethics Board (also called AI Review Board, AI Ethics Committee, or Responsible AI Committee) is a governance body that:

**Reviews** AI systems for ethical concerns
**Advises** on difficult or novel ethical questions
**Approves** (or rejects) high-risk AI deployments
**Guides** organizational AI ethics direction
**Escalates** unresolved issues to appropriate leadership


### What It's Not

An AI Ethics Board is not:

- A replacement for governance processes throughout AI development
- The only place ethics decisions happen
- A bottleneck that reviews every AI decision
- A PR exercise without real authority
- A technical review board (though technical understanding is needed)


### Where It Fits

## Types of AI Ethics Boards


### Internal Board

**Composition:** Employees from across the organization
**Authority:** Reviews, approves, and advises on AI projects
**Advantages:** Deep organizational knowledge, available, accountable
**Disadvantages:** May lack independence, potential groupthink


### External Advisory Board

**Composition:** Outside experts (academics, ethicists, civil society)
**Authority:** Advises; typically doesn't have approval power
**Advantages:** Independence, diverse perspectives, credibility
**Disadvantages:** Limited organizational knowledge, availability, cost


### Hybrid Board

**Composition:** Mix of internal and external members
**Authority:** Varies; often internal members approve, externals advise
**Advantages:** Balance of perspectives
**Disadvantages:** Coordination complexity


### Which to Choose?

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Early stage, building capability | Internal board |
| High public trust requirement | Hybrid or external |
| Regulated industry | Internal with external review |
| Consumer-facing AI | Hybrid recommended |
| Enterprise/internal AI | Internal often sufficient |
| Novel/unprecedented AI | External input valuable |

## Board Structure


### Size and Composition

**Recommended size:** 5-9 members

- Too small: Limited perspectives

- Novel AI applications without precedent
- AI systems with public visibility or reputational risk

**May review (at team request):**

- Medium-risk systems with ethical complexity
- Situations where teams want guidance
- Emerging issues without clear precedent

**Don't review:**

- Low-risk, routine AI applications
- Purely technical decisions
- Decisions already covered by policy

## Making the Board Effective


### Success Factors

**Clear authority:**
The Board must have real power to approve or reject. If decisions can be easily overridden, the Board becomes theater.

**Right members:**
Diverse expertise and perspectives, committed to the work, available for meetings.

**Adequate preparation:**
Members must actually review materials. Rushing through reviews doesn't work.

**Supportive culture:**
Teams should see the Board as helpful, not adversarial. This requires the Board to be constructive.

**Fast enough:**
If reviews take months, teams will avoid them. Balance thoroughness with timeliness.

**Follow-through:**
Conditions must be tracked and enforced. Recommendations must be acted upon.


### Common Failure Modes

**Failure 1: Rubber Stamp**

- Board approves everything
- Reviews are superficial
- No conditions or rejections

**Why it happens:** Pressure to not slow things down; members don't understand enough to challenge

**Fix:** Ensure independence; train members; require substantive review time

---

**Failure 2: Bottleneck**

- Reviews take too long
- Backlog builds up
- Teams avoid the Board

**Why it happens:** Too much scope; insufficient resources; indecision

**Fix:** Narrow scope; increase meeting frequency; establish timeframes

---

**Failure 3: Theater**

- Board exists but lacks authority
- Decisions are overridden
- Teams don't take it seriously

**Why it happens:** No executive support; no consequences for ignoring

**Fix:** Executive mandate; escalation process; accountability

---

**Failure 4: Groupthink**

- Same perspectives dominate
- Dissent is suppressed
- Blind spots persist

**Why it happens:** Homogeneous membership; hierarchical dynamics

**Fix:** Diverse membership; structured dissent; external perspectives

---

**Failure 5: Expertise Gap**

- Members don't understand AI
- Technical discussions go over heads
- Bad decisions result

**Why it happens:** Wrong composition; no training

**Fix:** Include technical members; train others; use technical advisors

---

**Failure 6: Disconnection**

- Board is isolated from development
- Reviews happen too late
- Guidance isn't practical

**Why it happens:** Board not integrated in AI lifecycle

**Fix:** Early engagement; office hours; embedded support


### Building Board Capability

**Training for members:**

- AI fundamentals for non-technical members
- Ethical frameworks and reasoning
- Regulatory landscape
- Organization's AI principles and policies

**Ongoing development:**

- Case studies of ethical AI challenges
- Guest speakers on emerging issues
- Peer learning from other organizations

---


## External Members and Advisors


### Why Include External Voices?

**Benefits:**

- Independence from internal pressures
- Fresh perspectives
- Specialized expertise not available internally
- Credibility with external stakeholders
- Challenge to internal assumptions

**Challenges:**

- Availability and scheduling
- Limited organizational context
- Confidentiality concerns
- Cost
- Integration with internal processes


### Models for External Involvement

**Full external membership:**
External members with voting rights on the board.

**Advisory role:**
External advisors provide input but don't vote.

**Periodic consultation:**
External experts consulted for specific issues.

**Annual review:**
External panel reviews Board effectiveness annually.


### Managing External Relationships

**Selection criteria:**

- Relevant expertise
- Independence (no conflicts of interest)
- Availability for regular participation
- Willingness to engage constructively

**Compensation:**

- Market rate for advisory services
- Per-meeting honorarium
- Annual retainer

**Confidentiality:**

- NDAs covering proprietary information
- Clear guidance on what can be discussed externally

## Measuring Board Effectiveness


### Metrics to Track

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Review volume | Number of projects reviewed |
| Review outcomes | Distribution of approvals, conditions, rejections |
| Time to decision | Average time from submission to decision |
| Condition compliance | Are conditions being met? |
| Appeals | How often are decisions appealed? |
| Incident correlation | Do reviewed projects have fewer issues? |
| Team satisfaction | Do teams find the Board helpful? |


### Annual Self-Assessment

Questions for the Board to consider annually:

1. Are we reviewing the right things?
2. Are our decisions making a difference?
3. Do we have the right composition?
4. Are we effective and efficient?
5. Do teams engage with us constructively?
6. Are we keeping up with AI developments?
7. What should we do differently?

## Conclusion

An AI Ethics Board can be a powerful governance mechanism—bringing diverse perspectives to consequential decisions and building organizational capacity for ethical AI. But it requires thoughtful design and disciplined execution.

Key takeaways:

1. **Define clear authority:** A board without power is theater. Give it real decision rights.

2. **Get the composition right:** Diverse perspectives, relevant expertise, committed members.

3. **Scope appropriately:** Review high-risk, not everything. Too much scope creates bottleneck.

4. **Run efficient processes:** Clear submissions, structured meetings, timely decisions.

5. **Avoid common failures:** Rubber stamps and bottlenecks are both governance failures.

6. **Build capability:** Train members, learn from cases, adapt over time.

7. **Measure and improve:** Track effectiveness and adjust.

The best ethics boards make organizations better at ethical AI—not just by catching problems, but by building the capability to do it right from the start.

## Why AI Training Matters


### The Knowledge Gap

Most organizations face significant AI knowledge gaps:

| Role | Typical Gap |
<!-- component:table:table-the-knowledge-gap -->
|------|-------------|
| Executives | Limited understanding of AI risks and governance needs |
| Business users | Don't know they're using AI; don't understand limitations |
| Product managers | Can't assess AI features for risk; don't know when to involve governance |
| Developers | Technical skills but limited ethics/governance awareness |
| Data scientists | Deep technical skills, varying governance awareness |
| Procurement | Traditional vendor assessment doesn't cover AI |
| Legal | Limited AI-specific legal knowledge |
| HR | Don't understand AI in hiring tools they use |


### Consequences of the Gap

**Uninformed decisions:**
People make AI decisions without understanding risks.

**Non-compliance:**
Policies exist but aren't followed because people don't know them.

**Missed issues:**
Problems aren't caught because people don't recognize them.

**Governance friction:**
Governance seen as obstacle because its purpose isn't understood.

**Ineffective governance:**
The right structures without the right capabilities.


### Training Objectives

Effective AI training should:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-training-objectives -->
1. **Create awareness:** Everyone understands AI basics and why governance matters
2. **Build knowledge:** Role-specific understanding of AI governance
3. **Develop skills:** Practical ability to perform governance activities
4. **Change behavior:** People actually do things differently
5. **Embed culture:** Responsible AI becomes "how we work"

## Training Delivery Methods


### Choosing the Right Method

| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
<!-- component:table:table-choosing-the-right-method -->
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **E-learning** | Tier 1, large audiences | Scalable, consistent, trackable | Less engaging, limited practice |
| **Videos** | Awareness, concepts | Engaging, reusable | Passive learning |
| **Webinars** | Updates, Q&A | Interactive, efficient | Scheduling, limited practice |
| **Workshops** | Skills development | Hands-on, interactive | Resource-intensive |
| **Coaching** | Behavior change | Personalized, effective | Not scalable |
| **On-the-job** | Skills application | Real context | Inconsistent |
| **Certification** | Practitioners | Validates competence | Development cost |


### Blended Approach

- Reading policies out loud
- Abstract theory without application
- Long, uninterrupted lectures

**Include:**
- Real examples and case studies
- Stories of what went wrong (and right)
- Interactive exercises
- Discussion and debate
- Practical application
- Humor (where appropriate)

- What do they currently know?
- What behaviors need to change?
- What skills are missing?

**Methods:**
- Surveys and assessments
- Interviews with key roles
- Observation of current practices
- Review of incidents and issues


### Phase 2: Design Curriculum

├── Has behavior changed?
└── Measure: Observation, compliance metrics

Level 4: Results
├── Has governance improved?
├── Are there fewer issues?
└── Measure: Governance metrics, incidents
```

your customer churn model has higher error rates for customers 
in certain geographic regions that correlate with demographic 
characteristics.

Questions:
1. What should you do immediately?
2. Who needs to know?
3. What investigation is required?

Discussion points:
- Bias detection and response
- Escalation requirements
- Investigation methodology
```


### Community of Practice

## Common Training Mistakes


### Mistake 1: One-Time Training

**The error:** Training once and considering people "trained."

**The problem:** Knowledge fades; the field changes; new people join.

**The fix:** Ongoing learning program, not an event.


### Mistake 2: Generic Content

**The error:** Same training for everyone.

**The problem:** Not relevant to specific roles; doesn't change behavior.

**The fix:** Audience-segmented, role-specific training.


### Mistake 3: Compliance Focus Only

**The error:** Training focused on "follow the rules."

**The problem:** Doesn't build understanding or capability.

**The fix:** Build understanding of why, not just what.


### Mistake 4: No Application

**The error:** Theory without practice.

**The problem:** Knowledge doesn't transfer to work.

**The fix:** Hands-on exercises, job aids, follow-up support.


### Mistake 5: No Measurement

**The error:** No tracking beyond completion.

**The problem:** Don't know if training is effective.

**The fix:** Measure learning and behavior change.

---


## Conclusion

AI governance policies don't implement themselves. People do. Training builds the knowledge, skills, and awareness needed to make governance work in practice.

Key takeaways:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-conclusion -->
1. **Segment your audience:** Different roles need different training.

2. **Design for outcomes:** Focus on behavior change, not just knowledge.

3. **Make it relevant:** Use real examples, practical exercises, applicable content.

4. **Deliver effectively:** Blend methods for engagement and impact.

5. **Measure and improve:** Track beyond completion; improve continuously.

6. **Build ongoing capability:** Training is a program, not an event.

7. **Support application:** Job aids, coaching, communities of practice.

The investment in training pays dividends in governance effectiveness—and in avoiding the costs of governance failures.

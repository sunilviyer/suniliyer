## What Is ISO 31000?


### The Standard's Purpose

ISO 31000 provides guidelines for managing risk faced by organizations. It's designed to:

- Be applicable to any organization, regardless of size, industry, or sector
- Be applicable to any type of risk, regardless of nature or cause
- Be used throughout the organization's life
- Support integration with other management activities


### Not Certifiable

Unlike ISO 27001 (information security) or ISO 42001 (AI management), ISO 31000 is not certifiable. It's a guidance document, not a requirements standard.

This means no third party will audit and certify your ISO 31000 compliance. Instead, ISO 31000 provides a reference framework that organizations adapt to their needs.


### The 2018 Version

The current version (ISO 31000:2018) is more concise than its 2009 predecessor. It emphasizes:
- Integration of risk management into all organizational activities
- Leadership responsibility for risk management
- Customization to organizational context
- Continual improvement

---

<!-- component:list:list-iso-31000-principles -->

## ISO 31000 Principles

ISO 31000 defines eight principles that characterize effective risk management:


### 1. Integrated

Risk management should be an integral part of all organizational activities, not a separate exercise.

**For AI:** AI risk management shouldn't be a standalone function that reviews AI projects after they're built. It should be embedded in how AI projects are planned, developed, and operated.

<!-- component:template:template-1-integrated -->
*Example:* Instead of having an "AI ethics review" as a gate before deployment, build risk considerations into sprint planning, code reviews, and testing processes.


### 2. Structured and Comprehensive

A systematic approach produces consistent, comparable results.

**For AI:** Use the same risk assessment methodology across AI systems so you can compare risks and prioritize resources effectively.

<!-- component:template:template-2-structured-and-comprehensive -->
*Example:* Create a standard AI risk assessment template used for all projects, ensuring consistent evaluation criteria and documentation.


### 3. Customized

The framework and process should be tailored to the organization and its context.

**For AI:** A healthcare organization's AI risk management will look different from a social media company's, even if both follow the same principles.

<!-- component:template:template-3-customized -->
*Example:* A hospital might weight patient safety heavily in AI risk assessments, while a marketing firm might weight reputational risk and consumer trust.


### 4. Inclusive

Stakeholder involvement improves awareness and informed risk management.

**For AI:** Include diverse perspectives—not just data scientists, but legal, ethics, affected communities, end users.

<!-- component:template:template-4-inclusive -->
*Example:* When assessing a hiring AI, include HR, legal, diversity officers, recruiters, and potentially job applicant advocates.


### 5. Dynamic

Risks can emerge, change, or disappear. Risk management anticipates and responds to change.

**For AI:** AI systems change over time (retraining, data drift), and the risk landscape evolves. Risk management must be ongoing, not one-time.

<!-- component:template:template-5-dynamic -->
*Example:* An AI trained on pre-pandemic data may perform poorly post-pandemic. Continuous monitoring detects this drift.

<!-- component:template:template-6-best-available-information -->

### 6. Best Available Information

Risk management is informed by historical data, expert judgment, stakeholder input, and other information, while acknowledging limitations.

**For AI:** Use testing data, academic research, incident reports, and expert opinion—but recognize uncertainty, especially for novel AI applications.

<!-- component:template:template-6-best-available-information -->
*Example:* When assessing bias risk, use available fairness metrics while acknowledging they don't capture all aspects of fairness.


### 7. Human and Cultural Factors

Human behavior and culture significantly influence risk management.

**For AI:** Technical controls alone aren't enough. Organizational culture, incentives, and human judgment all affect AI risk.

<!-- component:template:template-7-human-and-cultural-factors -->
*Example:* If developers are rewarded only for speed, risk considerations will be deprioritized regardless of policies.


### 8. Continual Improvement

Risk management improves through learning and experience.

**For AI:** Learn from incidents, near-misses, and successes. Update practices based on what works.

<!-- component:template:template-8-continual-improvement -->
*Example:* After an AI bias incident, analyze root causes and update assessment procedures to catch similar issues earlier.

## The ISO 31000 Framework

ISO 31000 distinguishes between framework (the organization's arrangements for risk management) and process (the activities of managing risk).


### Framework Components


#### Leadership and Commitment

Top management demonstrates commitment by:
- Defining risk management policy
- Allocating resources
- Assigning authority and responsibility
- Aligning risk management with objectives and strategy

**For AI:** Leadership must prioritize AI risk management, not just sign policies. This means budget, staffing, and decision-making authority.


#### Integration

Risk management should be integrated into:
- Governance structures
- Decision-making
- Organizational processes
- Planning and strategy

**For AI:** AI risk considerations should be part of project approvals, budget allocations, and strategic planning—not afterthoughts.


#### Design

Designing the framework includes:
- Understanding context
- Articulating risk management commitment
- Defining roles and responsibilities
- Allocating resources
- Establishing communication mechanisms

**For AI:** Design an AI risk management approach that fits your organization's structure, culture, and AI maturity.


#### Implementation

Put the framework into action through:
- Developing implementation plans
- Identifying decision points where risk should be considered
- Modifying processes to incorporate risk management

**For AI:** Roll out AI risk management practices systematically, starting with high-priority areas.


#### Evaluation

Measure effectiveness by:
- Reviewing performance against indicators
- Assessing continued appropriateness
- Identifying gaps and improvement opportunities

**For AI:** Track metrics like: AI incidents prevented, assessment completion rates, time to identify issues.


#### Improvement

Adapt and improve based on:
- Changes in context
- Lessons learned
- Performance gaps

**For AI:** Update AI risk practices as technology evolves, regulations change, and you learn from experience.

- Identify events, causes, and consequences
- Generate comprehensive list of risks
- Consider both threat risks and opportunity risks

**Risk Identification Methods:**
- Brainstorming
- Checklists
- Historical data analysis
- Expert interviews
- Scenario analysis
- SWOT analysis

<!-- component:template:template-risk-identification -->
**For AI Example:** Fraud detection AI risks might include:

| Risk | Source | Consequence |
<!-- component:table:table-risk-identification -->
|------|--------|-------------|
| False positives | Model sensitivity | Customer frustration, lost business |
| False negatives | Model misses fraud | Financial loss, regulatory action |
| Demographic bias | Training data bias | Discrimination claims, regulatory action |
| Adversarial attacks | Sophisticated fraudsters | Model bypass, fraud increase |
| Model drift | Changing fraud patterns | Degraded performance over time |
| System failure | Technical issues | Operational disruption |
| Privacy breach | Data handling errors | Regulatory fines, reputation damage |


### Risk Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand the nature and level of risk.

**Activities:**
- Assess likelihood of each risk
- Assess consequences if risk materializes
- Consider uncertainty and sensitivity
- Consider effectiveness of existing controls
- Determine risk level

**Analysis Approaches:**

**Qualitative:** Use scales like High/Medium/Low

**Semi-quantitative:** Use numbers representing scales (1-5)

**Quantitative:** Use actual probabilities and monetary values

<!-- component:template:template-risk-analysis -->
**For AI Example:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Consequence | Current Controls | Residual Risk |
<!-- component:table:table-risk-analysis -->
|------|------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| Demographic bias | Medium | High | Bias testing at launch | Medium-High |
| False positives | High | Medium | Human review thresholds | Medium |
| Model drift | High | Medium | Quarterly retraining | Low-Medium |

### Risk Evaluation

**Purpose:** Compare analysis results against criteria to determine required action.

**Activities:**
- Compare risk levels to defined criteria
- Prioritize risks for treatment
- Make decisions about treatment approach
- Consider risk interdependencies

<!-- component:template:template-risk-evaluation -->
**For AI Example:**

Based on criteria established earlier:
<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-risk-evaluation -->
- **Demographic bias:** Medium-High → Exceeds tolerance → Treatment required
- **Adversarial attacks:** Medium → Close to tolerance → Treatment recommended
- **Model drift:** Low-Medium → Within tolerance but monitor
- **False positives:** Medium → Acceptable but optimize


### Risk Treatment

**Purpose:** Select and implement options to address risks.

**Treatment Options:**

| Option | Description | AI Example |
<!-- component:table:table-risk-treatment -->
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Avoid | Don't proceed with risky activity | Don't deploy high-risk AI use case |
| Reduce | Decrease likelihood or consequence | Add bias mitigation techniques |
| Transfer | Shift risk to another party | Insurance, contractual allocation |
| Accept | Proceed knowing the risk | Deploy with documented acceptance |
| Exploit | Increase exposure to opportunity | Expand successful AI application |

**Treatment Process:**
1. Select treatment options
2. Prepare treatment plans
3. Implement plans
4. Assess residual risk
5. Document decisions

**For AI Example Treatment Plan:**

| Risk | Treatment | Actions | Owner | Timeline |

## Applying ISO 31000 to AI: A Practical Framework

Here's how to adapt the generic ISO 31000 process specifically for AI risks:


### AI Risk Identification Categories

When identifying AI risks, consider these categories:

**Data Risks:**
- Training data quality and bias
- Data privacy and protection
- Data availability and access
- Data drift and staleness

**Model Risks:**
- Algorithm bias and fairness
- Accuracy and reliability
- Explainability and transparency
- Robustness and security

**System Risks:**
- Integration with other systems
- Scalability and performance
- Availability and reliability
- Maintenance and updates

**Human Risks:**
- Over-reliance on AI
- Skill gaps and training needs
- Resistance and adoption
- Accountability gaps

**External Risks:**
- Regulatory changes
- Stakeholder expectations
- Competitive pressures
- Technological changes

<!-- component:list:list-ai-specific-risk-criteria -->

### AI-Specific Risk Criteria

Consider these factors when defining AI risk criteria:

**Impact on individuals:**
- Does the AI affect fundamental rights?
- Could it cause physical, psychological, or financial harm?
- Does it affect vulnerable populations?

**Reversibility:**
- Can AI decisions be undone?
- How quickly can harm be corrected?

**Scale:**
- How many people are affected?
- What's the geographic scope?

**Transparency:**
- Can the AI be explained?
- Can decisions be understood?


### AI Risk Treatment Considerations

When treating AI risks, consider:

**Technical controls:**
- Bias mitigation techniques
- Explainability methods
- Security measures
- Monitoring systems

**Procedural controls:**
- Human oversight requirements
- Approval processes
- Incident response procedures
- Audit mechanisms

**Governance controls:**
- Policies and standards
- Roles and responsibilities
- Accountability structures
- Training requirements

## ISO 31000 and Other Frameworks


### With NIST AI RMF

ISO 31000's risk assessment process (identify, analyze, evaluate, treat) maps well to NIST AI RMF's MEASURE and MANAGE functions. ISO 31000 provides the "how" of risk assessment while NIST AI RMF provides AI-specific considerations.


### With ISO 42001

ISO 42001 (AI management systems) incorporates risk-based thinking consistent with ISO 31000. Organizations can use ISO 31000 as the foundation for their ISO 42001 risk management processes.


### With EU AI Act

The EU AI Act requires risk management systems for high-risk AI. ISO 31000 principles and processes can structure compliance with these requirements.

---


## Conclusion

ISO 31000 provides a universal language and methodology for risk management. For AI governance, it offers several key benefits:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-conclusion -->
1. **Proven foundation:** Decades of risk management experience in a single standard

2. **Common language:** Facilitates communication between AI specialists and general risk management

3. **Integration:** Connects AI risk management to enterprise risk management

4. **Flexibility:** Adapts to different organizations and AI applications

5. **Continuous improvement:** Emphasizes learning and adaptation

The key insight is that AI risk management isn't separate from risk management—it's an application of it. Organizations with strong general risk management capabilities will find AI risk management more natural.

Start with ISO 31000 principles. Apply them using AI-specific considerations. Connect to specialized frameworks like the NIST AI RMF. The result is AI risk management that's both rigorous and practical.

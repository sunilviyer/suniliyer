# AIDefence V2 - Sprint Status Tracking
# Generated: 2025-12-22
# Project: AIDefence V2
# Tracking System: file-system
# Story Location: docs/sprint-artifacts

# ============================================================================
# CANONICAL REFERENCES - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
# ============================================================================
# All implementation work MUST reference these canonical files:
# - UX Specification: docs/aidefence-reference/ux-specification.md
# - Images Reference: docs/aidefence-reference/images-reference.md
# - Articles Reference: docs/aidefence-reference/articles-reference.md
# - Content Structure: docs/aidefence-reference/content-structure.md
# - PRD: docs/aidefence-v2-prd.md (74K)
# - Architecture: docs/architecture.md (55K)
# - Epics Overview: docs/epics.md (65K)
# - Epics Detailed: docs/epics/ folder (9 epic files)
#
# DO NOT create duplicate documentation. All epics reference these files.
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# STATUS DEFINITIONS
# ============================================================================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on (at least one story in progress)
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Workflow Notes:
#   - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
#   - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
#   - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done'
#   - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review workflow

  AIDefence V2 - Fresh Start
  =========================
  - All 8 epics are in backlog (no stories started yet)
  - V1 implementation completed, V2 is new architecture with earth-tone design
  - Implementation Readiness Check in progress (paused at Step 1)
  - Canonical reference folder established: docs/aidefence-reference/
  - All duplicate documentation moved to docs/obsolete/
  - Sprint planning will begin after readiness check completes

  Key Differences from V1:
  - Earth-tone design system (vs previous color scheme)
  - Expandable inline articles with FLIP animations (NEW)
  - 11 category colors with smart badge contrast (NEW)
  - Content organized via knowledge-graph.yaml (NEW)
  - 162 articles across 5 learning paths (140 exist, 22 need creation)
  - 187 images needed (34 created, 153 remaining)

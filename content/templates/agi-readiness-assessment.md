# AGI Readiness Assessment Framework

**Purpose**: Evaluate organizational preparedness for increasingly capable AI systems, from today's advanced models to potential Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

**Target Audience**: Business leaders, governance professionals, AI program managers, risk management teams

**Time to Complete**: 2-4 hours (initial assessment), ongoing monitoring

**Output**: Readiness score, gap analysis, prioritized action plan

---

## Why This Assessment Matters

**The Challenge**:
Even if AGI is uncertain or distant, AI capabilities are advancing rapidly. Organizations that wait for AGI to "arrive" will be unprepared for incrementally more capable systems that emerge along the way.

**What This Framework Does**:
- Assesses current state across 8 critical dimensions
- Identifies gaps in governance, technical capability, and organizational readiness
- Provides actionable roadmap for progressive preparation
- Works whether AGI arrives in 5 years, 50 years, or never

**Who Should Use This**:
- Organizations developing AI systems
- Organizations deploying third-party AI tools
- Governance and risk management teams
- Executive leadership planning AI strategy

---

## Assessment Overview

This assessment evaluates readiness across 8 dimensions:

1. **AI Literacy & Understanding** - Does leadership understand what AGI means and what's hype vs. reality?
2. **Governance Infrastructure** - Can current governance scale to more capable systems?
3. **Risk Management** - Can you identify and mitigate risks from increasingly capable AI?
4. **Technical Capability** - Can your teams evaluate, integrate, and monitor advanced AI safely?
5. **Organizational Flexibility** - Can you adapt quickly as AI capabilities change?
6. **Strategic Positioning** - How does increasing AI capability affect your business model?
7. **Ethical Framework** - Do you have principles that apply regardless of AI capability level?
8. **External Engagement** - Are you connected to developments in AI governance landscape?

**Scoring**:
- 1 = Unprepared (high risk)
- 2 = Basic awareness (significant gaps)
- 3 = Developing capability (gaps but progressing)
- 4 = Strong capability (well-positioned)
- 5 = Leadership (setting standards)

**Overall Readiness**:
- 8-16: Critical gaps - immediate action needed
- 17-24: Developing readiness - accelerate efforts
- 25-32: Solid foundation - targeted improvements
- 33-40: Strong readiness - maintain and refine

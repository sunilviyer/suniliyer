## Brazil's Path to AI Regulation


### Building on Data Protection Success

Brazil already has significant experience with tech regulation. The Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)—Brazil's General Data Protection Law—took effect in 2020, bringing GDPR-style data protection to Latin America's largest economy.

The LGPD experience taught Brazil several lessons:

- **Implementation matters**: Having a law is just the start; enforcement requires resources
- **International alignment helps**: LGPD's similarity to GDPR facilitated compliance for global companies
- **Local adaptation is necessary**: Brazilian specifics (like the different legal basis structure) required attention
- **Consumer awareness grows**: Brazilians increasingly understand their data rights

Brazil's AI Bill builds on this foundation, and the LGPD regulator (ANPD) plays a significant role in the proposed AI governance framework.


### The Legislative Process

Brazil's AI Bill has gone through several iterations:

**2020-2021**: Initial proposals and discussions
**2022**: Consolidation of various proposals
**2023**: PL 2338/2023 introduced with comprehensive framework
**2024**: Committee reviews and amendments
**Expected 2025**: Potential enactment

The bill has received input from multiple stakeholders—tech industry, civil society, academics, and government agencies—resulting in a relatively balanced (if complex) proposal.

## Key Provisions of the Brazilian AI Bill


### Risk-Based Classification

Like the EU AI Act, Brazil's bill creates a tiered system based on risk:


#### Excessive Risk (Prohibited)

AI systems that pose unacceptable risks are banned:

- Social scoring by public authorities
- Exploitation of vulnerable groups
- Subliminal manipulation
- Indiscriminate facial recognition in public spaces (with exceptions)

**Example**: A government system that scores citizens based on social behavior and restricts access to services based on those scores would be prohibited.


#### High Risk

AI systems affecting fundamental rights or safety require enhanced obligations:

- AI in education (admission, assessment)
- AI in employment (hiring, evaluation, termination)
- AI in credit and financial services
- AI in healthcare
- AI in law enforcement
- AI in migration and border control
- AI in democratic processes

**Example**: An AI system used by a bank to decide loan applications would be classified as high-risk and subject to extensive requirements.


#### Substantial Risk

AI systems that pose moderate concerns:

- Certain biometric systems
- AI interacting with vulnerable groups
- Other systems designated by regulation


#### Low Risk

All other AI systems—minimal specific obligations beyond general transparency.


### Rights for People Affected by AI

The bill creates a comprehensive set of rights:

**Right to information**: Know when AI is being used in decisions about you

**Right to explanation**: Understand how AI decisions are made

**Right to human review**: Request human review of AI decisions

**Right to contest**: Challenge AI decisions that affect you

**Right to non-discrimination**: AI systems cannot discriminate based on protected characteristics

**Right to data correction**: Correct inaccurate data used by AI systems

**Example application**: If a job applicant is rejected by an AI screening system, they would have the right to:
<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-rights-for-people-affected-by-ai -->
1. Know that AI was involved in the decision
2. Understand what factors the AI considered
3. Request human review of their application
4. Contest the decision if they believe it was wrong
5. Ensure the AI didn't discriminate against them


### Obligations for AI Actors

The bill distinguishes between different roles:

**AI Developers**: Those who create AI systems
- Technical documentation requirements
- Safety testing obligations
- Information provision to deployers

**AI Deployers**: Those who use AI systems
- Risk assessments
- Human oversight implementation
- User notification
- Complaint handling

**AI Importers**: Those who bring AI systems into Brazil
- Compliance verification
- Information provision

<!-- component:list:list-governance-requirements-for-high-risk-ai -->

### Governance Requirements for High-Risk AI

High-risk AI systems face significant obligations:

| Requirement | Description |
<!-- component:table:table-governance-requirements-for-high-risk-ai -->
|-------------|-------------|
| Risk Management | Ongoing risk assessment and mitigation |
| Data Governance | Quality standards for training data |
| Documentation | Technical documentation of system design |
| Logging | Record-keeping of AI system operations |
| Human Oversight | Meaningful human control over decisions |
| Accuracy | Performance monitoring and validation |
| Cybersecurity | Security measures for AI systems |


### The Regulatory Authority Question

One key debate in Brazil concerns who will regulate AI:

**Option 1: ANPD (Current Proposal)**
- The National Data Protection Authority would take on AI governance
- Advantage: Existing expertise and infrastructure
- Disadvantage: May be overwhelmed by additional responsibilities

**Option 2: New AI-Specific Agency**
- Create a dedicated AI regulatory body
- Advantage: Focused mandate and resources
- Disadvantage: Costs and coordination challenges

**Option 3: Sectoral Approach**
- Let existing sector regulators handle AI in their domains
- Advantage: Domain expertise
- Disadvantage: Potential inconsistency

The current bill trends toward ANPD leadership with sectoral coordination.

## How Brazil's Approach Compares


### Brazil vs. EU AI Act

| Aspect | Brazil AI Bill | EU AI Act |
<!-- component:table:table-brazil-vs-eu-ai-act -->
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Risk tiers | 4 levels | 4 levels |
| Prohibited AI | Similar categories | Similar categories |
| Rights-based | Strong individual rights | Less emphasis on rights |
| Regulator | Likely ANPD | National + EU authorities |
| Penalties | Up to 2% revenue or R$50M | Up to 7% revenue |
| Timeline | Expected 2025 | 2025-2027 |

**Key difference**: Brazil's bill has stronger emphasis on individual rights (explanation, contestation), reflecting Brazil's constitutional tradition of fundamental rights.


### Brazil vs. US Approach

| Aspect | Brazil | United States |
<!-- component:table:table-brazil-vs-us-approach -->
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Structure | National comprehensive law | State patchwork |
| Federal role | Central | Limited |
| Risk classification | Explicit | Implicit |
| Rights framework | Strong | Varies by state |


### Brazil vs. Other Latin American Countries

Brazil is leading Latin America in AI governance:

**Argentina**: Developing AI strategy but no comprehensive law yet
**Mexico**: National AI strategy without binding legislation
**Chile**: Constitutional reform mentions AI; legislation developing
**Colombia**: National AI policy; some sectoral rules

Brazil's law, once enacted, will likely influence the entire region.

Key takeaways for business leaders:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-conclusion -->
1. **Comprehensive legislation is coming**: Brazil will have one of the world's most complete AI frameworks
2. **Risk-based approach**: Classification will drive compliance obligations
3. **Strong rights framework**: Individual rights to explanation and contestation are central
4. **Regional influence**: Brazil's law will shape Latin American AI governance
5. **Prepare now**: Even before final enactment, businesses should assess their AI exposure

The Brazilian AI Bill shows that comprehensive AI governance is not just a European or American phenomenon. As AI becomes globally significant, regulatory responses are globalizing too. Companies that build robust AI governance now—wherever they are located—will be best positioned for this emerging global regulatory environment.

As one Brazilian AI executive noted: "We've been through this with LGPD. Companies that prepared early had a much easier time than those who scrambled at the last minute. The AI law will be the same. The time to prepare is now."

## Why a Patchwork? Understanding the US Regulatory Approach


### The Federal Vacuum

The US federal government has been slow to pass comprehensive AI legislation. While there have been executive orders (like President Biden's October 2023 Executive Order on AI), proposed bills, and agency guidance, no single federal AI law has been enacted as of 2024.

Several reasons explain this delay:

- **Political gridlock**: Congress struggles to pass major legislation on any topic
- **Rapid technological change**: Lawmakers worry about creating outdated rules
- **Industry lobbying**: Tech companies have pushed for self-regulation
- **Philosophical differences**: Debates about innovation versus protection


### States Step Into the Gap

When federal action stalls, states often become "laboratories of democracy"—testing different approaches to see what works. This happened with data privacy (California's CCPA inspired other state laws) and is now happening with AI.

**Think of it like this**: When your parents can't agree on house rules, your older siblings start making their own. Some are strict, some are lenient, and you end up with different rules depending on whose room you're in.


### The Commerce Clause Challenge

One important wrinkle: the US Constitution's Commerce Clause gives the federal government authority over interstate commerce. This means state AI laws that significantly burden companies operating across state lines could face legal challenges. However, until federal legislation arrives, states continue to fill the void.

## The Current State Landscape


### States with Comprehensive AI Laws

As of late 2024, several states have passed or are considering significant AI legislation:

**Colorado** (AI Act - SB 21-169)
- First comprehensive state AI law
- Focuses on "high-risk" AI systems
- Requires impact assessments and disclosures
- Takes effect February 2026

**California** (Multiple laws)
- AB 2013: Transparency for generative AI training data
- SB 1047: AI safety requirements (vetoed but influential)
- Various agency-specific rules

**New York City** (Local Law 144)
- Regulates AI in hiring (Automated Employment Decision Tools)
- Requires bias audits
- Already in effect since 2023

**Illinois** (Multiple laws)
- Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (2020)
- Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) applies to AI
- Proposed comprehensive AI legislation


### States with Targeted AI Rules

Many states have addressed specific AI applications rather than passing broad legislation:

| State | Focus Area | Key Requirement |
<!-- component:table:table-states-with-targeted-ai-rules -->
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Maryland | Facial recognition | Consent required for interviews |
| Texas | Deepfakes | Criminal penalties for harmful deepfakes |
| Washington | Facial recognition | Moratorium on government use |
| Vermont | Insurance AI | Disclosure requirements |
| Connecticut | AI in employment | Transparency requirements |


### States Watching and Waiting

Many states are monitoring developments before acting. They're watching to see:
- How Colorado's law is implemented
- Whether federal legislation emerges
- How courts interpret existing state laws
- What problems arise in practice

---


## Key Themes Across State Laws

Despite their differences, state AI laws share common themes:


### 1. Transparency and Disclosure

Almost every state law includes some form of disclosure requirement. Businesses must tell people when they're interacting with AI or when AI is making decisions about them.

**Example**: If your company uses a chatbot for customer service, California may require you to disclose that customers are talking to a bot, not a human.


### 2. High-Risk Focus

States generally don't try to regulate all AI. Instead, they focus on "high-risk" applications:
- Hiring and employment decisions
- Credit and lending
- Housing
- Healthcare
- Law enforcement

**Example**: An AI that recommends movies on Netflix faces fewer regulations than an AI that decides who gets a job interview.


### 3. Impact Assessments

Many states require companies to assess the potential harms of their AI systems before deployment. These assessments typically cover:
- Potential for discrimination
- Accuracy and reliability
- Privacy impacts
- Possible misuse


### 4. Human Oversight

States generally don't want AI making important decisions without human involvement. Laws often require:
- Human review of high-stakes AI decisions
- Ability to appeal AI decisions to a human
- Regular human monitoring of AI systems


### 5. Consumer Rights

Borrowing from data privacy laws, AI regulations often give individuals rights to:
- Know when AI is being used
- Understand how AI decisions were made
- Correct inaccurate data used by AI
- Opt out of AI decision-making

## Practical Implications for Businesses


### The Compliance Challenge

If your business operates in multiple states, you face a fundamental choice:

**Option 1: Comply with the strictest standard everywhere**
- Pros: Simplicity, future-proofing
- Cons: May be over-compliant (and over-costly) in many states

**Option 2: Tailor compliance to each state**
- Pros: Optimized costs, avoids unnecessary restrictions
- Cons: Complexity, risk of mistakes, ongoing monitoring required

**Option 3: Wait and see**
- Pros: Avoid premature investments
- Cons: Potentially scrambling when laws take effect, reputational risks

Most larger companies are choosing Option 1—building to the highest standard—because it's simpler and prepares them for likely federal legislation.


### Real-World Example: National Retailer

Consider a national retail chain that uses AI for:
- Hiring decisions (resume screening)
- Customer service (chatbots)
- Inventory management (demand forecasting)
- Marketing (personalized recommendations)

Their compliance requirements might look like this:

| AI System | NYC | Colorado | California | Illinois |
<!-- component:table:table-real-world-example-national-retailer -->
|-----------|-----|----------|------------|----------|
| Hiring AI | Bias audit required | Impact assessment | Disclosure | Video interview consent |
| Chatbot | Minimal | Consumer disclosure | Bot disclosure law | Minimal |
| Inventory | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal |
| Marketing | Minimal | If high-risk | Privacy notices | Minimal |

The hiring AI triggers the most regulations because employment decisions are universally considered high-risk.


### Building a Compliance Program

For businesses navigating the patchwork, here's a practical approach:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-building-a-compliance-program -->
1. **Inventory your AI systems**: Know what AI you're using and where
2. **Map to jurisdictions**: Understand which laws apply to each system
3. **Identify highest standards**: Determine the strictest applicable requirements
4. **Build to that standard**: Implement compliant processes
5. **Document everything**: Create audit trails
6. **Monitor for changes**: State laws are evolving rapidly

## The Federal Question


### Will Federal Law Preempt State Laws?

The big question for businesses: Will a federal AI law eventually override this patchwork?

**Arguments for federal preemption**:
- Creates uniform national standard
- Reduces compliance burden
- Prevents race to the bottom (or top)
- Industry prefers single rulebook

**Arguments against full preemption**:
- States as laboratories (California's privacy law influenced federal thinking)
- States can address local concerns
- Federal law might set floor, not ceiling
- Political difficulty of preemption

Most experts expect eventual federal legislation to set a national floor while allowing states to impose stricter requirements in some areas—similar to how federal and state privacy laws interact.


### Current Federal Activity

While comprehensive legislation remains elusive, federal activity includes:

- **Executive Order 14110** (October 2023): Directs agencies to address AI risks
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**: Voluntary guidance for AI developers
- **FTC Enforcement**: Using existing consumer protection authority
- **SEC Interest**: Examining AI in financial services
- **EEOC Guidance**: AI in employment decisions

These actions create additional compliance considerations alongside state laws.

## Comparing the US Approach to Other Countries


### US vs. European Union

| Aspect | United States | European Union |
<!-- component:table:table-us-vs-european-union -->
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Structure | State-by-state patchwork | Single comprehensive law |
| Timeline | Ongoing, varies by state | AI Act adopted 2024 |
| Scope | Targeted applications | All AI systems (risk-based) |
| Penalties | Varies by state | Up to 7% global revenue |
| Approach | Reactive, sectoral | Proactive, horizontal |


### Why the Difference?

The US and EU have fundamentally different regulatory philosophies:

**US Approach**: 
- React to problems as they arise
- Sector-specific regulation
- Balance innovation and protection
- Skepticism of broad government authority

**EU Approach**:
- Anticipate and prevent problems
- Horizontal regulation across sectors
- Emphasize precautionary principle
- Comfort with comprehensive regulation

Neither approach is inherently superior—they reflect different values and governance traditions.

## What's Coming Next


### Emerging Trends

Several trends are shaping the future of US AI regulation:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-emerging-trends -->
1. **More states joining**: Expect 10+ more states to pass AI laws by 2026
2. **Harmonization efforts**: Some coordination among states is emerging
3. **Sector-specific rules**: Healthcare, financial services, and employment getting extra attention
4. **Federal floor legislation**: Likely eventual federal law setting minimum standards
5. **Enforcement actions**: State attorneys general becoming more active


### Industries to Watch

Some industries face particularly complex state AI regulation:

- **Financial services**: State insurance commissioners, banking regulators
- **Healthcare**: State medical boards, health departments
- **Employment**: Labor departments, civil rights agencies
- **Education**: State education departments
- **Real estate**: Fair housing enforcement

## Conclusion

The US patchwork approach to AI regulation creates real challenges for businesses operating nationally. Without a single federal law, companies must navigate an evolving landscape of state requirements that vary in scope, stringency, and timeline.

However, this patchwork also offers opportunities. States are experimenting with different approaches, generating valuable data about what works. Forward-thinking companies can use this period to build robust AI governance programs that will serve them well regardless of how the regulatory landscape evolves.

The key takeaways for business leaders:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-conclusion -->
1. **Map your AI use to jurisdictions**: Know which state laws apply to your systems
2. **Build to the highest standard**: Preparing for the strictest requirements often makes sense
3. **Watch for changes**: This landscape is evolving rapidly
4. **Prepare for federal action**: Eventual federal legislation seems likely
5. **Document your governance**: Good records help with any regulatory regime

The patchwork is messy, but it's the reality American businesses must navigate. Those who build strong AI governance foundations now will be best positioned for whatever comes next.

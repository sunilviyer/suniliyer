tldr: The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) published January 2023 provides voluntary comprehensive guidance for managing AI risks based on extensive stakeholder input from over 240 organizations including tech companies, civil society groups, academic researchers, and government agencies. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology established 1901) develops voluntary frameworks based on best practices and scientific research that become influential through quality rather than mandates, following successful Cybersecurity Framework precedent that became de facto standard since 2014. The AI RMF has achieved global adoption beyond US borders due to quality research, flexibility across contexts and industries, free availability without licensing fees, neutral development without commercial interests, and connection to other frameworks (ISO, OECD, EU AI Act). The framework comprises two parts—Part 1 foundational information explaining AI risk thinking, what makes AI different, trustworthy AI characteristics, and stakeholder involvement; Part 2 core framework providing four functions, categories/subcategories, and suggested actions/outcomes. Trustworthy AI requires seven characteristics—valid and reliable (consistently does what supposed to), safe (no harm to people/property/environment), secure and resilient (resists attacks and recovers), accountable and transparent (responsible parties and understandable workings), explainable and interpretable (understand how conclusions reached), privacy-enhanced (protects personal information), and fair with harmful bias managed (equitable treatment without discrimination). Four core functions work as continuous cycle—GOVERN establishes culture/structures/processes for AI risk management (foundation with leadership commitment, policies, accountability, risk tolerance definition), MAP understands context where AI operates (inventory systems, purposes, users, affected stakeholders, use context, assumptions/limitations), MEASURE assesses/analyzes/tracks risks (testing, bias evaluation, security assessment, performance monitoring, risk documentation), MANAGE responds to risks (prioritize, implement treatments, document decisions, communicate, update based on lessons). The AI RMF Playbook provides companion practical guidance with suggested actions, transparency/documentation requirements, and AI actor tasks for each subcategory. Organizations create profiles—customized framework versions tailored to specific use cases, industries, or contexts—mapping situations to framework, identifying relevant elements, documenting current/target states, and highlighting gaps. Industry profiles are developing for financial services (credit decisions, fraud detection, trading), healthcare (patient safety, clinical decision support, diagnostics), and human resources (hiring, promotion, workforce management). The AI RMF aligns with other frameworks including EU AI Act risk management systems (Article 9), data governance (Article 10), record-keeping (Article 12), human oversight (Article 14); ISO standards (ISO 31000 risk management, ISO/IEC 42001 AI management system, ISO/IEC 23894 AI risk management); and OECD AI Principles mapping to seven trustworthy characteristics. Implementation follows five steps—get leadership buy-in presenting AI RMF as risk management, sustainable AI investment, regulatory preparation, and competitive advantage; conduct AI inventory documenting systems, users, decisions, data; assess current state comparing practices to framework; prioritize and plan based on risk levels, gap severity, resources, regulatory pressure; implement and iterate starting high-priority with continuous improvement. Common challenges include unknown AI systems requiring discovery surveys across business units and vendor contracts, overwhelming scope requiring context-scaled approaches using profiles, lack of AI expertise necessitating cross-functional teams pairing business leaders with data scientists, and difficulty measuring success requiring leading indicators like completed assessments and resolved issues. Organizations using AI RMF position themselves well for regulatory compliance, systematic risk management, stakeholder confidence, and responsible AI development.

## Summary

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework represents the most comprehensive, practical, and globally influential voluntary guidance available for managing AI risks systematically. Published in January 2023 as AI RMF 1.0, it emerged from extensive stakeholder collaboration involving over 240 organizations spanning technology companies, civil society groups, academic researchers, and government agencies, ensuring the framework reflects real-world needs rather than theoretical ideals.

NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), established in 1901 as a US federal agency, has a long history of developing frameworks that become de facto standards not through regulatory mandates but through quality and utility. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework published in 2014 exemplifies this pattern—it became the global standard for managing cyber risks because companies voluntarily adopted it for its effectiveness. The AI RMF follows this successful model, and despite being developed by a US agency, has achieved international adoption across Europe, Asia, and beyond.

The AI RMF's global influence stems from several factors: exceptional quality built on rigorous research and practical testing, flexibility that adapts to different organizational contexts and industries, free availability without licensing fees or membership requirements, neutral development without commercial interests that might bias recommendations, and intentional alignment with other frameworks including ISO standards, OECD AI Principles, and the EU AI Act.

The framework comprises two complementary parts. Part 1 provides foundational information explaining how to think about AI risks, what makes AI different from other technologies requiring specialized risk management approaches, the seven characteristics that define trustworthy AI systems, and which stakeholders should be involved in AI risk management. This serves as the conceptual foundation—the "why" and "what" of AI risk management.

Part 2 delivers the core practical framework with four functions for managing AI risk across the entire lifecycle, detailed categories and subcategories within each function providing granular guidance, and suggested actions and desired outcomes for each element. This operational guidance represents the "how" of AI risk management.

Before addressing risk management processes, the AI RMF defines what organizations should aim for through seven characteristics of trustworthy AI systems. Valid and reliable systems consistently perform their intended functions over time and across contexts. Safe systems avoid causing harm to people, property, or the environment even when errors occur. Secure and resilient systems resist adversarial attacks and recover from failures or degradations. Accountable and transparent systems have clear responsibility for decisions with understandable operations. Explainable and interpretable systems enable users to understand how conclusions are reached. Privacy-enhanced systems protect personal information and respect privacy rights throughout data lifecycles. Fair systems with harmful bias managed treat people equitably and avoid discriminatory outcomes.

The heart of the framework consists of four core functions working together in a continuous cycle rather than a linear process. GOVERN establishes the foundation by creating organizational culture, governance structures, and processes for AI risk management, including defining risk tolerance, establishing policies and procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities, creating accountability structures, and fostering responsible AI culture. Without proper governance, the other functions cannot operate effectively—this is where leadership commitment transforms AI risk management from abstract principle to operational reality.

MAP focuses on understanding the specific context in which AI systems operate by identifying and inventorying all AI systems, understanding their intended purposes and users, identifying potentially affected stakeholders beyond direct users, assessing the context of use including deployment environment and integration with other systems, and documenting assumptions and limitations that might affect system performance or appropriateness. You cannot manage risks you don't understand, making this contextual mapping essential before assessment.

MEASURE addresses actual risk evaluation through developing appropriate risk assessment approaches for different AI systems and use cases, testing for bias and fairness across relevant demographic groups and use contexts, evaluating security vulnerabilities including adversarial attack resistance, monitoring ongoing system performance against established benchmarks, and tracking and documenting risks throughout the AI lifecycle. This function puts evidence and data behind risk understanding rather than relying on assumptions.

MANAGE implements responses to identified risks by prioritizing risks for action based on severity and organizational capacity, implementing risk treatments including technical controls, process changes, or deployment restrictions, documenting decisions and rationale for accountability and learning, communicating with stakeholders about risks and mitigations, and updating practices based on lessons learned from monitoring and incidents.

NIST provides a companion AI RMF Playbook offering practical implementation guidance for each framework element. For each subcategory, the Playbook suggests specific actions to take, transparency and documentation requirements detailing what to record and how, and AI actor tasks identifying which roles should be involved. This transforms the framework from conceptual guidance into actionable steps that organizations can implement immediately.

Organizations are encouraged to create profiles—customized versions of the framework tailored to specific use cases, industries, or organizational contexts. A profile maps an organization's specific situation to the framework, identifies which elements are most relevant based on AI applications and risk levels, documents current state of practices for each relevant element, defines target state the organization wants to reach, and highlights gaps requiring attention. Industry-specific profiles are emerging for financial services focusing on credit decisions, fraud detection, and trading algorithms; healthcare emphasizing patient safety, clinical decision support, and diagnostic AI; and human resources addressing hiring, promotion, and workforce management AI.

The AI RMF intentionally aligns with other major frameworks and regulations to facilitate integrated compliance. EU AI Act requirements map closely to AI RMF functions—Article 9 risk management systems align with all four functions, Article 10 data governance aligns with MAP function, Article 12 record-keeping aligns with documentation throughout, and Article 14 human oversight aligns with GOVERN and MANAGE functions. Organizations implementing the AI RMF position themselves well for EU AI Act compliance. Similarly, the framework aligns with ISO 31000 risk management principles, ISO/IEC 42001 AI management system standards, and ISO/IEC 23894 AI-specific risk management guidance. The seven trustworthy AI characteristics map directly to OECD AI Principles adopted by over 40 countries.

Implementation follows a structured approach beginning with securing leadership buy-in by presenting the AI RMF as a means to manage reputational and legal risks, an investment in sustainable AI adoption positioning the organization for long-term success, preparation for emerging regulations worldwide, and a competitive advantage in responsible AI development and deployment. Without executive commitment and resources, AI risk management initiatives struggle.

Conducting a comprehensive AI inventory comes next—you cannot manage AI risks without knowing what AI systems exist. This includes systems in production use and under development, embedded AI in vendor products and platforms, AI built by individual business units potentially outside central oversight, and AI inherited from acquisitions or partnerships. For each system, document what it does, who uses it, what decisions it affects, and what data it uses.

Assessing current state involves evaluating existing practices against the framework for each AI system and each framework element, determining how current approaches compare to framework recommendations, and identifying gaps where practices fall short of desired states. This gap analysis prioritizes improvement efforts.

Prioritization and planning recognizes that not everything requires immediate attention. Prioritize based on risk level of AI applications (high-risk systems like hiring AI or medical diagnostics before lower-risk applications), gap severity (critical missing controls before nice-to-have improvements), resource requirements (quick wins before complex multi-year initiatives), and regulatory pressure (legally mandated elements before voluntary enhancements).

Implementation proceeds iteratively rather than attempting to implement the entire framework at once. Start with highest-priority items, demonstrate value and build momentum, then expand systematically. The AI RMF is designed for continuous improvement rather than one-time compliance—organizations should expect to cycle through the functions repeatedly as AI systems evolve and new risks emerge.

Common implementation challenges include discovering unknown AI systems scattered across the organization, requiring systematic discovery processes surveying business units, reviewing vendor contracts for embedded AI, and auditing technical systems. Organizations often find AI in unexpected places—marketing tools with recommendation algorithms, customer service chatbots, financial forecasting models, HR screening tools—none of which were conceived as "AI projects" but all of which pose AI risks.

The framework's comprehensiveness can seem overwhelming, especially for smaller organizations with limited resources. The solution lies in scaling to context—a startup with one AI product doesn't need the same governance apparatus as a Fortune 500 company with hundreds of AI systems. Profiles help organizations focus on what's relevant to their specific situations.

Many organizations lack deep AI expertise required to understand technical risks like adversarial attacks, training data bias, or model drift. Building cross-functional teams that pair business leaders understanding use cases and impacts with data scientists understanding technical capabilities and limitations addresses this gap. External expertise through consultants, academic partnerships, or industry associations can supplement in-house capabilities for initial assessments.

Measuring success in risk management poses challenges since you're often trying to prove a negative—risks that didn't materialize because of good practices. Organizations should track leading indicators including completed risk assessments showing coverage expanding across AI portfolio, issues identified and resolved demonstrating the process finds and fixes problems, policy adoption rates showing organizational buy-in, training completion ensuring staff understand their roles, and stakeholder feedback indicating external confidence in the organization's AI practices.

The AI RMF provides a proven, practical approach to managing AI risks that scales from small organizations to global enterprises, adapts to different industries and use cases, aligns with major regulatory requirements, and continuously improves as AI technology and understanding evolve. Organizations implementing the framework position themselves for regulatory compliance, systematic risk management reducing incidents and harms, stakeholder confidence from demonstrated responsible AI practices, and sustainable AI development supporting long-term business value.

## What Is NIST and Why Does It Matter?

### NIST's Role

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been around since 1901. They're the folks who maintain the official US time, define measurement standards, and create frameworks for everything from cybersecurity to manufacturing quality.

NIST doesn't make laws or enforce regulations. Instead, they develop voluntary frameworks based on best practices, scientific research, and extensive stakeholder input. Their work becomes influential because it's good, not because it's mandatory.

### The Cybersecurity Precedent

If you've worked in cybersecurity, you probably know the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Published in 2014, it became the de facto standard for managing cyber risks. Companies use it voluntarily because it works. Regulators reference it because it represents expert consensus.

The AI RMF follows the same model. NIST gathered input from over 240 organizations—tech companies, civil society groups, academic researchers, government agencies—to create a framework that reflects real-world needs.

### Why NIST AI RMF Has Gone Global

Even though NIST is a US agency, the AI RMF has been adopted internationally for several reasons:

1. **Quality**: It's well-researched and practical
2. **Flexibility**: It adapts to different contexts and industries
3. **Free**: No licensing fees or membership required
4. **Neutral**: NIST has no commercial interests
5. **Connected**: It aligns with other frameworks (ISO, OECD, EU AI Act)

## The AI RMF Structure: Two Parts

The AI RMF has two main components:

### Part 1: Foundational Information

This section explains:
- How to think about AI risks
- What makes AI different from other technologies
- Key characteristics of trustworthy AI
- Who should be involved in AI risk management

Think of Part 1 as the "why" and "what"—the conceptual foundation.

### Part 2: The Core Framework

This section provides:
- Four functions for managing AI risk
- Categories and subcategories within each function
- Suggested actions and outcomes

Think of Part 2 as the "how"—the practical guidance.

---

## Trustworthy AI: The Seven Characteristics

Before diving into risk management, the AI RMF defines what we're aiming for. Trustworthy AI systems should demonstrate seven characteristics:

### 1. Valid and Reliable

The AI should do what it's supposed to do, consistently.

*Example:* If you're using AI to detect fraudulent transactions, it should actually catch fraud (valid) and do so consistently over time (reliable), not just work well on test data.

### 2. Safe

The AI shouldn't cause harm to people, property, or the environment.

*Example:* An AI system controlling industrial equipment should have safeguards preventing dangerous operations, even if the AI makes an error.

### 3. Secure and Resilient

The AI should resist attacks and recover from problems.

*Example:* A facial recognition system shouldn't be fooled by adversarial images (security) and should continue functioning if part of the system fails (resilience).

### 4. Accountable and Transparent

Someone should be responsible for AI decisions, and the system's workings should be understandable.

*Example:* When an AI denies a loan application, the bank should be able to explain why (transparency) and someone should be accountable for that decision (accountability).

### 5. Explainable and Interpretable

People should be able to understand how the AI reaches its conclusions.

*Example:* A doctor using AI for diagnosis should understand why the AI suggests a particular condition, not just receive a percentage score.

### 6. Privacy-Enhanced

The AI should protect personal information and respect privacy rights.

*Example:* An AI trained on customer data should not leak personal information in its outputs or be vulnerable to attacks that extract training data.

### 7. Fair – With Harmful Bias Managed

The AI should treat people equitably and not discriminate unfairly.

*Example:* A hiring AI should not systematically disadvantage candidates based on gender, race, or other protected characteristics.

## The Four Core Functions

The heart of the AI RMF is four functions that work together as a continuous cycle:

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   GOVERN    │ (Foundation)
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │     MAP     │ (Understand Context)
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │   MEASURE   │ (Assess Risks)
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │   MANAGE    │ (Take Action)
    └─────────────┘
```

### Function 1: GOVERN

**Purpose:** Establish the culture, structures, and processes for AI risk management.

GOVERN is the foundation. Without proper governance, the other functions won't work effectively. This is where leadership commitment, policies, and accountability structures are established.

**Key Activities:**
- Define organizational AI risk tolerance
- Establish policies and procedures
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Create accountability structures
- Foster a culture of responsible AI

*CEO Translation:* This is about setting the tone from the top. It's deciding that AI risk management matters, putting someone in charge, and making sure everyone knows their role.

*Example:* A retail company creates an AI Ethics Board, appoints a Head of AI Governance, develops an AI policy, and includes AI risk discussions in quarterly board meetings.

### Function 2: MAP

**Purpose:** Understand the context in which your AI operates.

MAP is about understanding your specific situation—the AI systems you have, who's affected, what could go wrong, and what benefits you're trying to achieve.

**Key Activities:**
- Identify and inventory AI systems
- Understand intended purposes and users
- Identify potentially affected stakeholders
- Assess the context of use
- Document assumptions and limitations

*CEO Translation:* This is knowing what AI you actually have, who it affects, and what the stakes are. You can't manage risks you don't know about.

*Example:* A hospital maps all AI systems in use: diagnostic imaging AI (high risk, affects patient outcomes), scheduling optimization (lower risk, affects staff efficiency), and email filtering (minimal risk). Each gets documented with its purpose, users, and potential impacts.

### Function 3: MEASURE

**Purpose:** Assess, analyze, and track AI risks.

MEASURE is about actually evaluating risks—testing systems, analyzing potential harms, and monitoring ongoing performance.

**Key Activities:**
- Develop risk assessment approaches
- Test for bias and fairness
- Evaluate security vulnerabilities
- Monitor system performance
- Track and document risks

*CEO Translation:* This is putting numbers and evidence behind your risk understanding. Not just thinking something might go wrong, but actually testing to find out.

*Example:* The hospital runs bias testing on the diagnostic imaging AI, checking whether it performs equally well across patient demographics. They establish ongoing monitoring dashboards tracking accuracy, speed, and error rates.

### Function 4: MANAGE

**Purpose:** Respond to risks based on what you've learned.

MANAGE is about taking action—prioritizing risks, implementing controls, and responding to issues when they arise.

**Key Activities:**
- Prioritize risks for action
- Implement risk treatments
- Document decisions and rationale
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Update practices based on lessons learned

*CEO Translation:* This is actually doing something about the risks you've found. Fixing problems, adding safeguards, or sometimes deciding not to deploy an AI system at all.

*Example:* The hospital discovers the diagnostic AI is less accurate for certain patient populations. They respond by adding human review requirements for those cases, retraining the model with more diverse data, and informing clinicians of the limitation.

---

## The AI RMF Playbook

NIST didn't just publish the framework—they also created a companion Playbook with suggested actions for each subcategory. The Playbook is incredibly practical, offering specific steps you can take.

### Playbook Structure

For each area of the framework, the Playbook provides:
- **Suggested Actions:** Concrete steps to take
- **Transparency and Documentation:** What to record
- **AI Actor Tasks:** Who should be involved

### Example: Playbook Entry for Bias Testing

For the MEASURE function's bias assessment category, the Playbook suggests:

**Suggested Actions:**
- Establish processes for bias testing before deployment
- Use multiple fairness metrics appropriate to context
- Test across relevant demographic groups
- Document testing methodology and results

**Transparency and Documentation:**
- Record bias testing procedures
- Document fairness metrics selected and why
- Maintain records of test results
- Note any limitations or gaps in testing

**AI Actor Tasks:**
- Data scientists: Conduct technical testing
- Domain experts: Validate appropriateness
- Legal/compliance: Review for regulatory requirements
- Leadership: Review and approve deployment decisions

---

## Profiles and Use Cases

The AI RMF encourages organizations to create "profiles"—customized versions of the framework tailored to specific use cases, industries, or organizational contexts.

### What Is a Profile?

A profile maps your specific situation to the framework. It identifies:
- Which framework elements are most relevant
- Current state of your practices
- Target state you want to reach
- Gaps to address

### Industry Profiles

NIST and industry groups are developing profiles for specific sectors:

**Financial Services:** Focuses on credit decisions, fraud detection, trading algorithms

**Healthcare:** Emphasizes patient safety, clinical decision support, diagnostic AI

**Human Resources:** Addresses hiring, promotion, and workforce management AI

### Creating Your Own Profile

Even without an industry profile, you can create one for your organization:

1. **Identify your AI use cases** (inventory from MAP function)
2. **Assess risk levels** for each use case
3. **Select relevant framework elements** based on risk
4. **Document current practices** for each element
5. **Identify gaps** between current and target state
6. **Prioritize improvements** based on risk and resources

---

## How the AI RMF Connects to Other Frameworks

One of the AI RMF's strengths is how well it integrates with other standards and regulations.

### EU AI Act Alignment

The EU AI Act references risk management requirements that align closely with the AI RMF:
- Risk management systems (Article 9) ↔ All four functions
- Data governance (Article 10) ↔ MAP function
- Record-keeping (Article 12) ↔ Documentation throughout
- Human oversight (Article 14) ↔ GOVERN and MANAGE functions

Organizations using the AI RMF will be well-positioned for EU AI Act compliance.

### ISO Standards

The AI RMF aligns with ISO standards:
- **ISO 31000** (Risk Management): Similar risk management concepts
- **ISO/IEC 42001** (AI Management System): Complementary approaches
- **ISO/IEC 23894** (AI Risk Management): Directly related

### OECD AI Principles

The seven trustworthy AI characteristics map to the OECD AI Principles adopted by 40+ countries.

---

## Implementation: Getting Started

### Step 1: Get Leadership Buy-In

The GOVERN function requires executive commitment. Present the AI RMF as:
- A way to manage reputational and legal risks
- An investment in sustainable AI adoption
- A framework that prepares you for coming regulations
- A competitive advantage in responsible AI

### Step 2: Conduct an AI Inventory

You can't manage AI risks without knowing what AI you have. Create a comprehensive inventory:
- What AI systems are in use or development?
- Who uses them?
- What decisions do they affect?
- What data do they use?

### Step 3: Assess Current State

For each AI system and each framework element:
- What are we currently doing?
- How does it compare to the framework?
- What gaps exist?

### Step 4: Prioritize and Plan

Not everything needs immediate attention. Prioritize based on:
- Risk level of the AI application
- Gap severity
- Resource requirements
- Regulatory pressure

### Step 5: Implement and Iterate

Start with high-priority items, then expand. The AI RMF is designed for continuous improvement, not one-time compliance.

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: "We Don't Know What AI We Have"

Many organizations discover they have AI systems they didn't know about—embedded in vendor products, built by individual teams, or inherited from acquisitions.

**Solution:** Start with a discovery process. Survey business units, review vendor contracts, audit technical systems.

### Challenge 2: "This Seems Like a Lot of Work"

The full AI RMF can seem overwhelming, especially for smaller organizations.

**Solution:** Scale to your context. A startup with one AI product doesn't need the same apparatus as a Fortune 500. Use profiles to focus on what's relevant.

### Challenge 3: "We Don't Have AI Expertise"

Understanding AI risks requires some technical knowledge.

**Solution:** Build cross-functional teams. Pair business leaders with data scientists. Consider external expertise for initial assessments.

### Challenge 4: "How Do We Measure Success?"

It's hard to prove a negative—risks that didn't materialize.

**Solution:** Track leading indicators: completed assessments, issues identified and resolved, policy adoption rates, training completion.

## Detailed Example: The AI RMF in Practice

### MidWest Insurance Co. Case Study

**Company:** MidWest Insurance Co.
**AI Application:** Claims processing automation
**Context:** AI reviews claims and recommends approval/denial; human adjusters make final decisions

#### GOVERN Phase

MidWest establishes:
- AI Risk Committee (meets monthly)
- AI Policy requiring risk assessment for all AI projects
- Claims Director accountable for this AI system
- Risk tolerance: "No systematic bias in claim decisions"

#### MAP Phase

MidWest documents:
- System purpose: Accelerate claims processing while maintaining accuracy
- Users: Claims adjusters, supervisors
- Affected parties: Policyholders (including vulnerable populations)
- Data used: Claim forms, medical records, policy details
- Key assumption: Historical claims data reflects fair decisions

#### MEASURE Phase

MidWest conducts:
- Accuracy testing across claim types
- Bias analysis by policyholder demographics
- Security assessment of data handling
- Ongoing monitoring of approval/denial rates

**Finding:** AI recommends denial 15% more often for claims from certain zip codes, even after controlling for claim characteristics.

#### MANAGE Phase

MidWest responds:
- Implements additional human review for flagged zip codes
- Initiates investigation into training data
- Plans model retraining with bias mitigation
- Documents decision and communicates to regulators proactively

## Conclusion

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is the most practical, comprehensive guide available for managing AI risks. It's not a compliance checklist—it's a way of thinking about AI risks that helps organizations make better decisions.

Key takeaways:

1. **Start with GOVERN:** Leadership commitment and clear structures are foundational
2. **Know your context (MAP):** You can't manage risks you don't understand
3. **Test and monitor (MEASURE):** Assumptions about AI need verification
4. **Take action (MANAGE):** Assessment without action is just paperwork
5. **Iterate continuously:** AI risk management is ongoing, not one-time

The AI RMF is free, well-documented, and supported by an extensive playbook. There's no reason not to start using it today.

Whether you're a CEO trying to understand what your team should be doing, or an AI governance professional building a program, the AI RMF gives you a proven framework to follow.

tldr: Foundation models are large AI models trained on broad data adaptable to many downstream tasks through transfer learning - one expensive training produces reusable capabilities. Only handful create frontier models (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta LLaMA, Mistral) due to $10M-$100M+ costs, massive data requirements, specialized expertise, thousands of GPUs, and custom infrastructure. Three deployment approaches - API consumers (no infrastructure, pay-per-use, provider-dependent), fine-tuners (domain customization, moderate ML expertise/compute, open or closed models), self-hosters (full control, infrastructure investment, open-weight models only). Governance challenges include black box opacity (billions of parameters, undisclosed training data, unpredictable emergent capabilities, variable prompting behavior), homogenization risk (correlated failures across ecosystem, shared bugs/biases/vulnerabilities), emergent capability risk (unexpected tool use, reasoning enabling attacks, unanticipated persuasion), and accountability gaps (unclear responsibility across provider-fine tuner-developer-deployer-user chain with liability disclaimers). EU AI Act addresses through "general-purpose AI" provisions requiring transparency/documentation for providers, systemic risk model requirements, and downstream deployer responsibilities. Selection criteria include capability fit for tasks, deployment model (API/fine-tuning/self-hosting), cost structure (per-token vs infrastructure), terms/policies (acceptable use, data handling, liability, SLAs), and risk profile (safety testing, known limitations, responsible development track record). Open-weight models provide control/customization/data-stays-local/infrastructure-costs but lag frontier capability while closed models offer state-of-art/provider-support/safety-measures/per-use-pricing but limited control/transparency. Organizations must implement layered governance (foundation model, adaptation, application, deployment layers), risk-based approaches (high-risk requiring extensive testing/mandatory human oversight/real-time monitoring/regular audits, medium-risk with standard testing/human review edge cases, lower-risk with basic verification/user training), and essential policies (acceptable use, model management, incident response, vendor management). Future trends include improved reasoning/reliability/efficiency/context-length/multimodal-integration/agentic-behavior but hallucination elimination and explainability remain challenging.

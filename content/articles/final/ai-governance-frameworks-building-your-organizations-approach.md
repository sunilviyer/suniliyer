tldr: Building effective AI governance requires understanding foundational frameworks - OECD's updated AI definition (machine-based systems inferring how to generate outputs influencing environments), ISO/IEC 22989 standardized terminology now freely available for global alignment, and OECD's five-dimension classification framework (People & Planet impacts, Economic Context, Data & Input, AI Model characteristics, Task & Output). AI systems are socio-technical combining technology with human agents and institutions, requiring interdisciplinary expertise beyond computer science. Five core AI use cases include recognition/detection (patterns, faces, speech, anomalies), forecasting/prediction (future events, behaviors, risks), personalization (tailored content, recommendations), goal-driven optimization (routing, scheduling, resource allocation), and content generation (text, images, code, music). Organizations must recognize that AI governance requires expertise from UX designers, anthropologists, sociologists, ethicists, and domain experts addressing workflow integration and human factors from design outset. Different AI systems require distinct governance approaches - smartphone facial recognition versus mass surveillance, virtual assistants versus self-driving vehicles, each demanding sector-specific frameworks. The OECD Classification Framework enables AI inventories, risk assessment, incident reporting, and cross-jurisdictional policy discussions with common language. Understanding these building blocks provides governance professionals shared vocabulary to work across disciplines, organizations, and borders as AI becomes increasingly prevalent.

## Summary

Effective AI governance begins with shared definitions and frameworks enabling consistent policy across disciplines and borders. The OECD updated its AI definition in November 2023: "An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments." This definition is incorporated globally including the EU AI Act, Council of Europe, Japan, and United States. ISO/IEC 22989:2022 establishes standardized AI terminology now publicly available, defining critical concepts like bias, fairness, and explainability essential for policy discussions. AI systems are fundamentally socio-technical - not just code and algorithms but including people, processes, rules, and organizational contexts working together. Human factors are critical: who labels training data, who interprets outputs, who decides when to override. Healthcare AI implementation failures typically stem from ignoring workflow integration where technology works in labs but fails in clinical settings. The OECD Framework for Classification of AI Systems (2022) provides five dimensions for policy characterization: (1) People & Planet - who is affected, impacts on human rights/wellbeing/environment, (2) Economic Context - sector, deployer, business model, (3) Data & Input - data types, collection methods, quality, (4) AI Model - type, transparency, robustness, (5) Task & Output - function, decisions, opt-out capability. Different AI systems require distinct governance - facial recognition for smartphone security versus mass surveillance, virtual assistants versus self-driving vehicles versus children's video recommendations each demanding different policy approaches. Five core AI use cases drive different regulatory requirements: recognition/detection (identifying patterns, objects, faces, speech, anomalies), forecasting/prediction (future events, trends, behaviors, risks triggering high-risk classification), personalization (tailoring content, recommendations, experiences combining multiple techniques), goal-driven optimization (finding optimal solutions within constraints for routing, scheduling, resource allocation), and content generation (creating text, images, code, music through generative AI). Organizations must recognize governance requires interdisciplinary expertise beyond computer science - UX designers, anthropologists, sociologists, ethicists, domain experts addressing "last mile" implementation challenges actually determined in early design stages. The classification framework enables AI inventories and registries, supports risk assessment and incident reporting, enables sector-specific governance (healthcare, finance requiring distinct approaches), and provides common language for cross-jurisdictional policy discussions.

## Key Learning Objectives

After reading this article, you will be able to:

1. **Apply OECD AI definition** - Machine-based systems inferring output generation influencing environments, updated November 2023
2. **Use ISO/IEC 22989 terminology** - Standardized concepts (bias, fairness, explainability) for consistent policy communication
3. **Understand socio-technical nature** - AI as combined technology, human agents, institutions requiring workflow integration from design
4. **Apply five-dimension classification** - People/Planet, Economic Context, Data/Input, AI Model, Task/Output for system characterization
5. **Identify five core use cases** - Recognition/detection, forecasting/prediction, personalization, goal-driven optimization, content generation
6. **Build interdisciplinary teams** - UX designers, anthropologists, sociologists, ethicists, domain experts beyond computer scientists
7. **Implement risk-based governance** - Different AI systems (smartphone vs surveillance, virtual assistant vs self-driving) require distinct approaches
8. **Create AI inventories** - Use classification framework dimensions for comprehensive system documentation and registries
9. **Enable cross-jurisdictional work** - Shared vocabulary for policy discussions across organizations, disciplines, borders
10. **Link use cases to regulations** - High-risk classifications under EU AI Act tied to forecasting/prediction in sensitive domains

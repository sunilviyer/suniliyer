tldr: Multimodal AI processes and generates multiple data types (text, images, audio, video) enabling systems that see, hear, and speak through modality-specific encoders, fusion mechanisms, and paired cross-modal training. Visual content risks include privacy (face recognition, personal info extraction, location data, private spaces), deception (fake photographs, misleading evidence, deepfakes, document forgery), and harmful content (inappropriate imagery, non-consensual images, violent content, copyright violations). Image generation governance addresses misinformation (fake event photos, manipulated public figures, synthetic evidence), intellectual property (style mimicking, training data reproduction, unclear ownership), and consent violations (unauthorized real-person images, inappropriate depictions, false contexts) through watermarking, content credentials, input filtering, output detection, and content filters. Audio/voice risks encompass cloning (individual impersonation, fraud/social engineering, fake evidence, unauthorized voice use), synthetic speech (robocall scams, fake customer service, voice identity fraud, misleading audio), requiring consent, authentication, disclosure, and detection. Video generation multiplies all risks at scale through deepfakes (realistic fake videos, political manipulation, fraud/blackmail, trust erosion) and overwhelming content moderation. Cross-modal attacks exploit interaction surfaces via visual prompt injection (hidden instructions in images, embedded text, adversarial patterns), audio prompt injection (hidden commands, ultrasonic frequencies, adversarial audio), and cross-modal confusion (conflicting information, cross-modal reasoning gaps, filter bypasses). Current multimodal systems include vision-language models (GPT-4V, Claude 3), image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney), audio/video models with emerging real-time interaction, 3D generation, embodied AI, spatial computing integration. Organizations must implement data handling policies (image/audio processing restrictions, retention, visual data privacy, audio consent), content generation policies (permitted types, synthetic media disclosures, prohibited categories, watermarking), use case restrictions (deepfake prohibitions, high-risk approval requirements, identity restrictions), technical controls (input filtering, face detection handling, PII detection, watermarking, metadata embedding, monitoring), and compliance with EU AI Act biometric restrictions/deepfake disclosure, US state laws, China deep synthesis regulations. C2PA Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity provides cryptographic signing, chain of custody tracking, industry standard for establishing authenticity.

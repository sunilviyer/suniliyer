Behind those simple interactions lies something remarkable: systems trained on billions of examples. That is artificial intelligence at work, though perhaps not in the way science fiction prepared you to expect.</p>  <p>You might wonder why we often use a single label to describe everything from a simple spam filter to a car that drives itself. To govern AI effectively, we must first stop treating it as a "magic pill" and start seeing it as a set of specific, manageable components. Here is the key insight: AI is not about creating conscious machines that think like humans. It is about building systems that can learn patterns from data and make useful predictions or decisions.</p>    <h2>Building Intuition: The Difference Between Rules and Learning</h2>  <p>Think of it this way. If you wanted to teach a computer to identify a fraudulent credit card transaction using traditional software, you would write thousands of "if-then" rules. IF the purchase is in another country AND the amount is over $500, THEN flag it. This is standard automation, and it works—but it is brittle. If a fraudster changes their behavior just slightly, the rules break.</p>  <p>AI works differently. Instead of writing rules, we give the computer millions of examples of transactions and let it find the patterns itself. Think of the difference between a calculator and a mathematician—one follows precise instructions, while the other understands underlying principles. Modern AI is incredibly good at finding these patterns, but it lacks the "common sense" humans use to navigate the world.</p>  <p>This realization was a major theme during the <card type="example" id="ex-dartmouth-workshop">1956 Dartmouth Workshop</card>, where the term "artificial intelligence" was first coined by scientists who were perhaps a bit too optimistic about how fast we would solve it.</p>  <h2>The Official Definition</h2>  <p>To regulate AI, you must first define its boundaries. If our definitions are too broad, we end up over-regulating simple spreadsheets; if they are too narrow, we miss dangerous new technologies. Most global regulations, including the <card type="framework" id="fw-eu-ai-act">EU AI Act</card>, now point to a shared map.</p>  <p>The OECD defines an AI system as a machine-based system that receives inputs and makes "inferences"—essentially, it looks at data to find patterns. Based on those patterns, it generates outputs like predictions, recommendations, or content that can influence the real or virtual world. Because this definition focuses on learning rather than coding, it helps us distinguish between actual AI and simple robotic process automation (RPA).</p>  <h2>AI as a Socio-Technical System</h2>  <p>One of the most common mistakes in governance is treating AI as "just software." In reality, AI is what we call a socio-technical system. This is a professional way of saying that the technology does not exist in a vacuum. It is a combination of the math (the "technical") and the people, rules, and organizational culture (the "socio").</p>  <p>Think of an airplane. The engine and wings are the technology, but they are useless without the pilot's training, the air traffic control rules, and the maintenance schedules. AI is no different. We must look at who labels the training data, who interprets the model's results, and who has the authority to hit the "off" switch when things go wrong. Governance serves as the pilot for these powerful engines.</p>  <h2>The Practical Takeaway</h2>  <p>You do not need a computer science degree to lead an AI initiative. But you do need to understand how to categorize these tools across your organization. Use the <card type="framework" id="fw-oecd-ai-principles">OECD AI Principles</card> as a guide to determine exactly how much oversight a specific system needs.</p>  <p>When you encounter a new tool, ask yourself these three questions:</p>  <ul>    <li>Who is being affected? (People & Planet)</li>    <li>What is the data source? (Data & Input)</li>    <li>Can we see how it decided? (AI Model)</li>  </ul>  <p>With this foundation in place, you are ready to explore the different branches of the AI family tree to see exactly what we mean when we talk about narrow AI versus general AI.</p>

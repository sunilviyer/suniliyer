  <h2>Beyond the specialist</h2>\
  <p>Think of it this way: when you build a team, you might hire an exceptional accountant who is brilliant with numbers but knows nothing about marketing. In the AI world, we call this a "specialist" approach. As we have seen in our look at The AI Family Tree, almost every system we use today is a highly focused tool designed for a specific boundary.</p>\
  <p>Here is the key insight: most of the value AI creates today comes from these specialized systems, but the risks we must govern change fundamentally as these systems become more "general." To lead effectively, you should understand where your tools sit on the spectrum of intelligence.</p>\
\
  <h2>Narrow AI: The exceptional specialist</h2>\
  <p>Every AI tool your organization currently uses\'97whether it is a spam filter, a recommendation engine, or a fraud detection system\'97is Narrow AI. These systems are like calculators: they are remarkably fast at one job but entirely helpless at anything else. For example, a system like <card type="insight" id="insight-netflix-personalization-savings">Netflix's personalization algorithm</card> can save a company $1 billion annually by predicting what you want to watch, yet it cannot even begin to schedule a meeting or write a simple email.</p>\
  <p>When you evaluate these tools, it is important to remember that their "intelligence" is bounded by their training data. A common governance challenge is ensuring these specialists do not encode human biases. Consider a <card type="scenario" id="sc-sarah-loan-denial">loan denial scenario</card> where an AI uses zip codes or shopping patterns as proxies for risk; the system might be accurate, but it could be perpetuating historical discrimination without you realizing it.</p>\
\
  <h2>The journey toward AGI and ASI</h2>\
  <p>You might wonder why researchers are so focused on <card type="concept" id="concept-agi">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</card> if it does not exist yet. AGI would be like an employee who can learn any task a human can, transferring knowledge from HR to finance to marketing seamlessly. Leading experts like Sam Altman and Geoffrey Hinton believe we could see this transition within the next decade or two.</p>\
  <p>Beyond that lies Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a level of intellect that outthinks human brains in every field, from social skills to complex strategy. For a CEO, ASI wouldn't just be a tool; it would be a strategic partner capable of redesigning your entire organizational structure. This raises a profound governance question: how do you oversee a system that is significantly smarter than the people managing it?</p>\
  <p>To understand this challenge, consider the <card type="scenario" id="sc-paperclip-maximizer">paperclip maximizer dilemma</card>. It illustrates how a superintelligent system might pursue a literal goal so effectively that it causes catastrophic unintended consequences, not because it is "evil," but because it lacks human values.</p>\
\
  <h2>Creators vs. Classifiers</h2>\
  <p>Regardless of the intelligence level, most AI systems fall into two functional camps: Discriminative or Generative. Discriminative AI acts like a screening committee; it looks at data and classifies it\'97predicting if a transaction is fraud or if an applicant is qualified.</p>\
  <p>Generative AI, on the other hand, is a creator. It learns patterns to produce brand-new content like text, images, or code. When your marketing team uses a tool to draft social media posts, they are using generative intelligence. While discriminative AI risks focus on bias, generative AI introduces new concerns regarding authenticity and intellectual property.</p>\
\
  <h2>Summary and Next Steps</h2>\
  <p>I hope you find, as I do, that categorizing AI this way makes it much easier to decide which oversight is necessary. Narrow AI requires technical accuracy and bias checks, while general systems require a much deeper focus on value alignment and safety.</p>\
  <p>Now that we have mapped out these levels of intelligence, we are ready to look at the "how" behind the magic. In our next article, How Machines Learn, we will explore the actual training methods that move these systems from random numbers to useful business tools.</p>}

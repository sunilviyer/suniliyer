  <h2>The Summer of Great Expectations</h2>\
  <p>Imagine thinking you could solve the entire mystery of intelligence in just two months. In the summer of 1956, a small group of scientists gathered at <card type="milestone" id="ms-dartmouth-workshop">Dartmouth College</card> with exactly that plan. They believed that every aspect of learning could be described so precisely that a machine could simulate it. While they were spectacularly wrong about the timeline\'97we are still working on it seven decades later\'97that workshop gave the field its name: Artificial Intelligence.</p>\
  <p>Think of it this way: AI wasn't born from a slow, steady climb. It was born from a burst of wild optimism. Early pioneers like Arthur Samuel built a checkers program that could beat its creator, and optimism ran so high that some predicted machines would do any work a man could do within twenty years.</p>\
\
  <h2>The Seasons of AI: Understanding the Winters</h2>\
  <p>When technology fails to meet grand promises, reality often bites back. By the early 1970s, the British government released the <card type="milestone" id="ms-lighthill-report">Lighthill Report</card>, which concluded that AI research had fundamentally failed to deliver. Funding plummeted, and the first "AI Winter" began. A second winter followed in the late 1980s when "expert systems"\'97tools that tried to hard-code human expertise\'97proved too brittle and expensive to maintain.</p>\
  <p>Here is the key insight: For a governance professional, these winters are a cautionary tale. History shows us that overpromising leads to underfunding. When we manage AI today, we must distinguish between real capabilities and the "marketing release" hype to ensure we don't trigger another cycle of disappointment.</p>\
\
  <h2>From Games to Modern Intelligence</h2>\
  <p>The thaw of the modern era began with benchmarks that the whole world could see. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated a world chess champion, but it did so through sheer "brute force" calculation rather than learning. The real shift toward the intelligence we see today happened in 2012. A neural network called <card type="milestone" id="ms-alexnet-imagenet">AlexNet</card> won a major image recognition challenge by a staggering margin, proving that deep learning could finally work if you had enough data and powerful hardware.</p>\
  <p>Perhaps the most profound moment for modern intuition was the <card type="example" id="ex-deepmind-alphago">AlphaGo victory</card> in 2016. Unlike previous systems, AlphaGo didn't just follow rules; it taught itself by playing millions of games against itself. It made moves so unconventional that human experts initially thought the machine had made a mistake. It was a clear sign that AI had moved from "calculating" to "learning patterns" at a level we could no longer easily predict.</p>\
\
  <h2>Why History Is Your Map</h2>\
  <p>As we conclude our look at the foundations of AI, you might wonder why this history matters for your current strategy. It matters because we are currently living through the most significant boom in the field's history, triggered by the <card type="milestone" id="ms-chatgpt-release">release of ChatGPT</card> in 2022. This explosion of interest has brought back the same level of excitement we saw in 1956.</p>\
  <p>By understanding where we came from, you can lead with perspective. You can recognize that while the current capabilities are real, our tendency toward overconfidence is also a historical pattern. Governance serves as the steady hand that allows your organization to capture the benefits of these breakthroughs while building the structures\'97risk management, oversight, and culture\'97that will outlast the current cycle of hype.</p>}

## Main Content


### Section 1: Defining AI - The OECD and ISO/IEC Frameworks

* **Key points to cover:**
   * The OECD updated its AI definition in November 2023 to stay current with technological developments
   * The OECD definition: "An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments"
   * ISO/IEC 22989:2022 establishes standardized terminology for AI concepts—now available for free to promote global alignment
   * Common elements across definitions: technology that processes inputs, makes inferences, and generates outputs that influence environments
   * These definitions are used globally—in the EU AI Act, by the Council of Europe, in Japan, and the United States

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * The EU AI Act directly incorporates the OECD definition, demonstrating how standardized definitions enable regulatory interoperability
   * ISO/IEC 22989 defines key terms like "bias," "fairness," and "explainability" that are essential for policy discussions

* **Practical implications:**
   * Without agreed definitions, organizations can't consistently inventory their AI systems
   * Governance professionals need to understand these frameworks to communicate across jurisdictions
   * Definitions determine what falls under AI regulations—and what doesn't

### Section 2: AI as Socio-Technical Systems

* **Key points to cover:**
   * AI systems are not just code and algorithms—they include people, processes, rules, and organizational contexts
   * A socio-technical system consists of technologies, human agents, and institutions (formal and informal rules) working together
   * Human factors are critical: who labels the training data, who interprets the outputs, who decides when to override the system
   * AI systems are autonomous, interactive, and adaptive—they learn from their environment in ways traditional systems don't

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * Healthcare AI implementation failures often stem from ignoring workflow integration—the technology works in the lab but fails in clinical settings
   * Amazon's hiring algorithm failed not because of bad code, but because it learned from decades of biased human hiring decisions
   * ChatGPT is disrupting education not through technical capabilities alone, but through how humans integrate it into existing practices

* **Practical implications:**
   * Governing AI requires expertise beyond computer science: UX designers, anthropologists, sociologists, ethicists, and domain experts
   * "Last mile challenges" of implementing AI are actually decisions made in early design stages
   * Human factors experts should be involved from the outset of AI development, not as an afterthought

### Section 3: The OECD Classification Framework

* **Key points to cover:**
   * The OECD Framework for Classification of AI Systems (2022) helps policymakers characterize AI systems for governance purposes
   * Five classification dimensions:
     1. **People & Planet**: Who is affected? What are impacts on human rights, wellbeing, environment?
     2. **Economic Context**: What sector? Who deploys it? What's the business model?
     3. **Data & Input**: What data does it use? How is it collected? What's the quality?
     4. **AI Model**: What type of model? How transparent? How robust?
     5. **Task & Output**: What does it do? What decisions does it make? Can users opt out?
   * The framework links AI system characteristics to the OECD AI Principles
   * Different AI systems require different governance approaches—a restaurant recommendation and a criminal sentencing algorithm shouldn't be treated the same

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * Facial recognition: excellent for smartphone security, potentially dangerous for mass surveillance—same technology, vastly different governance needs
   * Virtual assistant vs. self-driving vehicle vs. video recommendations for children—each requires distinct policy approaches

* **Practical implications:**
   * The framework helps organizations build AI inventories and registries
   * Supports risk assessment and incident reporting
   * Enables sector-specific governance frameworks (healthcare, finance, etc.)
   * Provides common language for cross-jurisdictional policy discussions

### Section 4: AI Use Cases & Benefits

* **Key points to cover:**
   * **Recognition and Detection**: Identifying patterns, objects, faces, speech, anomalies
   * **Forecasting and Prediction**: Predicting future events, trends, behaviors, risks
   * **Personalization**: Tailoring content, recommendations, experiences to individual users
   * **Goal-driven Optimization**: Finding optimal solutions within constraints (routing, scheduling, resource allocation)
   * **Content Generation**: Creating text, images, code, music (generative AI)

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * **Netflix**: Personalization algorithms recommend content based on viewing history—estimated to save $1 billion annually in customer retention
   * **Siri/Alexa**: Speech recognition + natural language processing + personalization combined
   * **ChatGPT**: Generative AI that combines pattern recognition, prediction, and content generation
   * **Google Maps**: Goal-driven optimization for route planning
   * **Medical imaging AI**: Recognition and detection for identifying tumors, fractures, abnormalities

* **Practical implications:**
   * Understanding use cases helps governance professionals assess appropriate risk levels
   * Different use cases trigger different regulatory requirements (high-risk vs. minimal risk under EU AI Act)
   * Benefits must be weighed against potential harms when designing governance frameworks

## Conclusion

AI isn't magic, and it isn't truly "intelligent"—it's a set of technologies that process inputs, make inferences, and generate outputs. But understanding what AI actually is requires more than technical knowledge. It requires recognizing that AI systems are socio-technical systems embedded in human contexts, shaped by human decisions, and affecting human lives.

The OECD definition, ISO/IEC 22989 terminology, and the OECD Classification Framework give governance professionals the shared vocabulary they need to work across disciplines, organizations, and borders. As AI becomes more prevalent, these building blocks become essential tools for anyone working to ensure AI benefits society while minimizing harms.

**Next steps:** Familiarize yourself with the OECD AI Principles and the OECD Framework for Classification of AI Systems. Start thinking about AI systems you interact with daily—how would you classify them? What dimensions matter most for governance?

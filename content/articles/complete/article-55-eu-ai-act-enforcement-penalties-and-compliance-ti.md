## The Penalty Structure: Three Tiers of Fines

The EU AI Act establishes three tiers of administrative fines based on the severity of the violation:


### Tier 1: Up to €35 Million or 7% of Global Revenue

*For the most serious violations*

This tier applies to:
- **Prohibited AI practices** (Article 5 violations)
- Deploying banned AI systems like social scoring or subliminal manipulation

*Example*: A company implements an AI system that rates employees based on their social behavior, using that score to determine promotions and raises. This violates the prohibition on social scoring and could face a Tier 1 fine.


### Tier 2: Up to €15 Million or 3% of Global Revenue

*For high-risk and GPAI violations*

This tier applies to:
- Non-compliance with **high-risk AI requirements** (Articles 9-15)
- Non-compliance with **GPAI model obligations**
- Violations by **notified bodies** (organizations that do third-party conformity assessments)

*Example*: A company sells hiring AI in Europe without proper technical documentation, risk management, or conformity assessment. This would face a Tier 2 fine.


### Tier 3: Up to €7.5 Million or 1% of Global Revenue

*For less serious violations*

This tier applies to:
- Providing **incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information** to authorities or notified bodies

*Example*: A company claims its AI system meets certain accuracy levels in its conformity declaration, but testing reveals the claims were significantly exaggerated.


### Special Rules for SMEs and Startups

Recognizing that startups and small businesses can't absorb fines the way large corporations can, the EU AI Act includes:

- **Lower caps for SMEs**: The lower of the absolute euro amount or percentage applies
- **Proportionality requirement**: Fines must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive—regulators should consider the company's size and resources
- **Specific startup considerations**: Authorities must consider how penalties affect the viability of new businesses


### How Fines Are Calculated

When determining fine amounts, authorities must consider:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-how-fines-are-calculated -->
1. **Nature, gravity, and duration** of the violation
2. **Intentional or negligent** character of the infringement
3. **Actions taken to mitigate** harm
4. **Degree of responsibility** given technical measures in place
5. **Previous violations** by the same operator
6. **Degree of cooperation** with authorities
7. **Manner in which authorities became aware** (self-reporting helps)
8. **Financial benefits gained** or losses avoided due to the violation
9. **Scale of the violation** (how many people affected?)

## Comparing to Other Regulations

How do EU AI Act fines stack up against other major regulations?

| Regulation | Maximum Fine | Revenue Percentage |
<!-- component:table:table-comparing-to-other-regulations -->
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **EU AI Act** (prohibited AI) | €35 million | 7% |
| **EU AI Act** (high-risk) | €15 million | 3% |
| **GDPR** | €20 million | 4% |
| **EU Digital Services Act** | €20 million | 6% |
| **EU Digital Markets Act** | N/A | 10% (up to 20% repeat) |

The EU AI Act's 7% penalty for prohibited AI practices exceeds GDPR's maximum of 4%. This signals how seriously the EU takes certain AI harms.

## Who Enforces the EU AI Act?

Enforcement happens at two levels: national and EU-wide.


### National Market Surveillance Authorities

Each EU member state must designate one or more **national competent authorities** to enforce the AI Act.

These authorities:
- **Supervise** AI systems in their markets
- **Investigate** complaints and potential violations
- **Conduct** market surveillance activities
- **Issue** corrective orders
- **Impose** fines for violations

*In practice*: If you're selling AI systems in Germany, the German national authority will oversee your compliance. If you sell across Europe, you may deal with multiple national authorities.


### The EU AI Office

Established under the AI Act, the **EU AI Office** has special responsibilities for:

- **GPAI model oversight**: Directly supervising foundation model providers
- **Coordination**: Helping national authorities work together
- **Guidance**: Issuing interpretation guidance and codes of practice
- **Systemic risk monitoring**: Watching for AI risks that cross borders

The AI Office can:
- Request information from GPAI providers
- Conduct evaluations and testing
- Request remedial measures
- Impose fines on GPAI model providers


### Notified Bodies

For certain high-risk AI systems, third-party **notified bodies** conduct conformity assessments. These are organizations authorized by EU member states to verify that AI systems meet requirements.

*Think of them like*: The vehicle inspection stations that verify cars meet safety standards—except for AI systems.

- Systemic risk providers face additional requirements


### Phase 3: Full Application (August 2, 2026)

**24 months after entry into force**
- Most high-risk AI requirements become applicable
- Transparency obligations for limited-risk AI apply
- Full enforcement begins

**What This Means**:
If you provide or deploy high-risk AI systems:
- All seven high-risk requirements must be met
- Conformity assessment must be complete
- CE marking and EU database registration required
- Deployer obligations take effect


### Phase 4: Extended Deadline for Certain Products (August 2, 2027)

**36 months after entry into force**

## What Happens in Practice: Enforcement Scenarios


### Scenario 1: The Undocumented High-Risk System

**Situation**: A software company sells resume-screening AI in Germany without proper technical documentation or conformity assessment.

**Detection**: A job applicant files a complaint with the German national authority after being rejected without explanation.

**Investigation**: The authority requests the provider's documentation. The company can't produce adequate technical documentation or evidence of conformity assessment.

**Outcome**: The authority orders the company to:
<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-scenario-1-the-undocumented-high-risk-system -->
1. Withdraw the product from the German market
2. Complete proper conformity assessment within 90 days
3. Pay a fine of €8 million (3% of annual revenue)


### Scenario 2: The Banned Practice

**Situation**: An employer uses AI to score employees based on their social media activity and off-work behavior.

**Detection**: An employee reports the practice to authorities.

**Investigation**: The authority confirms the system categorizes employees based on non-work behavior and uses those scores for promotion decisions.

**Outcome**: This is a prohibited practice (social scoring). The company must:
1. Immediately cease using the system
2. Delete collected scores
3. Pay a fine of €25 million (7% of annual revenue)


### Scenario 3: The Systemic Risk Failure

**Situation**: A major foundation model is exploited to generate sophisticated phishing emails at scale, causing €50 million in fraud losses across Europe.

**Detection**: Multiple member states report surge in AI-generated fraud.

**Investigation**: The EU AI Office investigates the model provider's systemic risk mitigation measures.

**Finding**: The provider failed to implement adequate adversarial testing and had no incident response plan.

**Outcome**: The AI Office:
1. Orders enhanced cybersecurity measures within 30 days
2. Requires implementation of abuse detection systems
3. Mandates quarterly security audits
4. Imposes a €100 million fine

## Key Risk Factors for Enforcement

Certain situations increase your enforcement risk:


### High-Risk Situations

- Operating in multiple EU member states
- Handling high-risk AI in sensitive sectors (hiring, credit, healthcare)
- High-volume consumer-facing AI applications
- History of privacy or consumer protection violations
- Operating GPAI models with wide distribution


### Warning Signs

- Incomplete documentation
- No designated AI governance responsibility
- Lack of conformity assessment
- No human oversight mechanisms
- Customer or employee complaints about AI decisions

## Conclusion

The EU AI Act's enforcement framework is designed to have teeth. Penalties that can reach 7% of global revenue get attention at the board level. The phased timeline gives organizations time to prepare—but that time is limited.

The key dates to remember:
- **February 2025**: Prohibited practices must stop
- **August 2025**: GPAI rules apply
- **August 2026**: Full high-risk requirements apply

Organizations that start now will be positioned for compliance. Those who wait risk enforcement action, reputational damage, and significant financial penalties.

The EU AI Act isn't just another regulation to manage—it's a transformation in how AI is governed. Treat it accordingly.

## Who's Behind It?

AI-powered misinformation comes from multiple sources with different motivations.


### State Actors

Nation-states have long engaged in propaganda and information warfare. AI dramatically increases their capabilities.

Russia's Internet Research Agency was exposed for its role in the 2016 U.S. election. Since then, Russian operations have continued and evolved, incorporating AI tools for content generation and targeting.

China has built extensive domestic censorship and propaganda capabilities, increasingly deployed for international influence operations.

Iran, North Korea, and other nations maintain their own information warfare capabilities.

These operations aren't limited to elections. They target social cohesion, economic confidence, alliance relationships, and public health (as seen with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation).


### Domestic Political Actors

Not all misinformation comes from foreign adversaries. Domestic political operatives, campaigns, and partisan organizations also deploy AI-powered misinformation.

The New Hampshire robocall was created by an American political consultant. Domestic misinformation networks have been traced to campaign operatives, political action committees, and party-aligned organizations.

Domestic actors often have advantages over foreign ones: native language fluency, cultural knowledge, and understanding of local issues. AI helps foreign actors close these gaps but doesn't eliminate domestic misinformation's advantages.


### Commercial Operators

Some misinformation is produced purely for profit. Fake news sites generate advertising revenue from clicks. AI reduces the cost of content creation, making even low-traffic sites potentially profitable.

During the 2016 election, Macedonian teenagers created fake news sites about American politics—not for political reasons, but because sensational political content drove traffic and advertising revenue. AI makes such operations more scalable.


### Ideological Actors

True believers in various causes—conspiracy theories, extremist movements, fringe political positions—use AI to produce and spread content supporting their views. They may not see themselves as spreading "misinformation"; they believe they're spreading truth that mainstream sources suppress.


### Individual Bad Actors

Trolls, harassers, and individuals with personal grievances can now produce sophisticated misinformation cheaply. An angry ex-employee, a rejected suitor, a personal enemy—anyone with a laptop can create convincing false content.

<!-- component:template:template-individual-bad-actors -->
**Example: The Profit-Motivated Factory**

Investigation revealed a network of AI-powered misinformation sites operated by a small company in Eastern Europe. The company had no political agenda—they created sites for all political positions, testing which content generated the most engagement and advertising revenue.

During election seasons, they shifted to political content because it performed better. They didn't care which side they helped; they cared about clicks. AI allowed a team of fewer than ten people to operate hundreds of sites across multiple languages.

## What Can Be Done?

The AI misinformation challenge has no simple solution. But multiple interventions, applied together, can reduce the harm.

<!-- component:template:template-platform-responsibility -->

### Platform Responsibility

Social media platforms are the primary distribution channel for misinformation. Their policies and technologies matter enormously.

**Algorithmic Reform**: Platforms could reduce algorithmic amplification of sensational content, even at the cost of engagement metrics. Some have experimented with slowing down viral spread, requiring friction before sharing, or reducing recommendations for borderline content.

**Labeling and Context**: Flagging content from known misinformation sources, providing context from fact-checkers, and labeling AI-generated content all help users evaluate what they see.

**Bot and Fake Account Detection**: Identifying and removing inauthentic accounts—especially those using AI-generated profiles—reduces the synthetic social proof that makes misinformation seem credible.

**Transparency**: Providing researchers and regulators access to data about content amplification, advertising targeting, and platform decisions enables oversight and accountability.


### Regulatory Approaches

Governments can establish rules for the information environment without directly regulating speech.

**AI Transparency Requirements**: The EU AI Act requires that AI-generated content be labeled as such. Similar requirements elsewhere could help users identify synthetic content.

**Platform Accountability**: Laws can require platforms to take reasonable steps to address illegal content or foreign influence operations, with enforcement for failures.

**Election-Specific Rules**: Regulations targeting misinformation during election periods—cooling-off periods before elections, rapid takedown requirements, disclosure of political advertising—can protect the most vulnerable moments for democracy.

**Foreign Influence Disclosure**: Requiring disclosure of foreign funding or control of media operations helps users understand the source of content.


### Media and Journalism

Professional journalism remains a critical defense against misinformation, though it faces economic challenges.

**Fact-Checking Operations**: Dedicated fact-checking organizations and fact-checking teams within news organizations counter false claims, though they struggle with the volume AI enables.

**Source Verification**: Journalists must develop skills to verify AI-generated content, detect deepfakes, and identify synthetic sources.

**Media Literacy Coverage**: News organizations can help audiences understand the misinformation environment through explicit coverage of tactics and techniques.

**Collaborative Defense**: News organizations can share verification tools, coordinate on major misinformation events, and pool resources for detection and response.


### Individual Resilience

Ultimately, every citizen is responsible for their own information consumption.

**Source Verification**: Before sharing, verify the source. Is it a known outlet? Does it have real journalists? Does the story appear elsewhere in reliable sources?

**Emotional Pause**: Content that triggers strong emotional reactions—outrage, fear, disgust—deserves extra scrutiny. Emotional manipulation is a misinformation tactic.

**Lateral Reading**: Don't just evaluate a source's own claims about itself. Check what others say about it. Search for the source name plus "fake" or "bias" to find evaluations.

**Slow Down**: The urgency to share immediately serves misinformation. Taking time to verify breaks the viral cycle.

**Diverse Sources**: Consume information from multiple sources across the political spectrum. Filter bubbles make misinformation harder to recognize.


### Organizational Actions

Organizations—businesses, nonprofits, educational institutions—can take specific steps.

**Employee Training**: Train employees to recognize misinformation, especially targeted misinformation that might impersonate the organization or its leadership.

**Verification Protocols**: Establish protocols for verifying information before acting on it or sharing it, especially for sensitive decisions.

**Crisis Planning**: Plan for misinformation attacks targeting the organization. Who responds? What channels are used? How quickly can you mobilize?

**Information Hygiene**: Be careful about the information environment you create. Don't share unverified content, even internally. Model good information practices.

<!-- component:template:template-organizational-actions -->
**Example: The Prepared Institution**

A major university anticipated that it might be targeted by misinformation during a controversial campus event. They pre-positioned verified information on their website, briefed local media, established a rapid response team, and monitored social media for emerging false narratives.

When misinformation did emerge—false claims about violence that never occurred—they were able to counter quickly with verified information, video from campus security cameras, and statements from credible witnesses. The false narrative failed to take hold because the truth was available faster.

## The Deeper Challenge

Technical solutions and institutional reforms can reduce the harm from AI-powered misinformation. But the deeper challenge is cultural and epistemological.

How do we maintain shared truth in an age when any content can be fabricated? How do we sustain the common factual ground that democracy requires? How do we rebuild trust in institutions that produce and validate knowledge?

These aren't technology questions. They're questions about human society, social trust, and collective decision-making. Technology created the problem; technology alone won't solve it.

The answer, if there is one, lies in reinforcing the human and institutional practices that have always been the foundation of truth-seeking: expertise, accountability, transparency, verification, and the patient work of building reliable knowledge over time.

AI makes that work harder. It doesn't make it impossible. But it requires deliberate effort from platforms, governments, journalists, educators, and individual citizens—all of us who have a stake in democracy's survival.

## Conclusion

The New Hampshire robocall that opened this article was quickly identified as fake. The consultant responsible faces criminal charges. The immediate damage was limited.

But the ease of the attack is what matters. A few dollars, a few hours, publicly available tools—that's all it took to impersonate the President of the United States and attempt to suppress voter turnout in a democratic election.

What happens when thousands of such attacks occur simultaneously, too fast for debunking, too numerous for prosecution? What happens when AI-generated misinformation becomes so prevalent that citizens can't distinguish signal from noise?

We're about to find out.

The 2024 elections worldwide will be the first major test of democracy in the age of generative AI. The lessons we learn—and the systems we build in response—will shape the information environment for decades to come.

Democracy has survived previous information challenges: the printing press, mass media, the early internet. It can survive AI too. But only if we recognize the threat, build defenses, and commit to the hard work of maintaining shared truth in an age of infinite synthetic falsehoods.

The machines can generate lies at scale. Only humans can commit to truth.

### 4.2 Visual Communication

```
AI VISUAL COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

PRINCIPLES:

Clarity over Cleverness:
• Use simple visuals that clarify, not impress
• Avoid abstract AI imagery (robot hands, glowing brains)
• Show real benefits and real people

Accuracy over Hype:
• Visuals should reflect actual capabilities
• Avoid imagery suggesting sentience or superintelligence
• Don't oversell or dramatize

Inclusivity:
• Represent diverse users and stakeholders
• Avoid reinforcing stereotypes
• Consider accessibility needs

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EFFECTIVE VISUAL APPROACHES:

Process Diagrams:
✓ Show how AI fits into workflows
✓ Illustrate human-AI collaboration
✓ Clarify decision processes

Before/After:
✓ Show tangible improvements
✓ Demonstrate time savings
✓ Illustrate quality improvements

Infographics:
✓ Summarize governance practices
✓ Explain complex processes simply
✓ Present data accessibly

Screenshots/UI:
✓ Show actual product interfaces
✓ Demonstrate features
✓ Set accurate expectations

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IMAGERY TO AVOID:

Don't Use:
✗ Terminator-style robots
✗ Glowing blue brains
✗ Matrix-style code
✗ Robotic hands touching human hands
✗ Abstract "AI" visualization
✗ Surveillance imagery (eyes, cameras)
✗ Imagery suggesting AI consciousness

Why: These images can trigger fear, create unrealistic
expectations, or seem tone-deaf to legitimate concerns.

Instead Use:
✓ Real people using technology
✓ Collaborative work scenarios
✓ Clear diagrams and charts
✓ Product screenshots
✓ Outcome-focused imagery
```

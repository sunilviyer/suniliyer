## California's Regulatory Philosophy

<!-- component:template:template-the-brussels-effect-in-american-form -->

### The "Brussels Effect" in American Form

Scholars talk about the "Brussels Effect"—how EU regulations become global standards because companies find it easier to adopt one approach worldwide than to maintain different practices for different markets.

California creates a similar "Sacramento Effect":
- California has 39 million residents (12% of the US population)
- California's GDP exceeds that of most countries
- Many tech companies are headquartered there
- Compliance complexity makes national adoption simpler

**Translation**: When California passes a law, companies nationwide often adopt it as their standard.


### Multiple Laws, One Direction

Rather than passing an omnibus AI Act, California has pursued individual laws addressing:
- Generative AI transparency
- Deepfakes and synthetic media
- Bot disclosure
- AI safety (proposed)
- Algorithmic discrimination
- Children's data and AI

This approach has pros and cons:

**Advantages**:
- Faster passage (smaller bills move easier)
- Targeted to specific harms
- Easier to update individual provisions
- Less industry opposition per bill

**Disadvantages**:
- Patchwork can create gaps
- Multiple compliance requirements
- No unified framework
- Potential inconsistencies

## Key California AI Laws


### AB 2013: Generative AI Training Data Transparency (2024)

**What it does**: Requires developers of generative AI systems to publicly disclose information about their training data.

**Who it applies to**: Any person or entity that creates, codes, or produces a generative AI system that's available for use in California.

**Key requirements**:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-ab-2013-generative-ai-training-data-transparency-2024 -->
1. **Training data documentation**: Developers must make available a high-level summary of the datasets used to train the AI
2. **Public disclosure**: Information must be posted on the developer's website
3. **Update requirements**: Disclosures must be updated as training data changes

**What must be disclosed**:
- Description of datasets used for training
- Whether the data includes personal information
- Whether the data includes copyrighted material
- Sources of the data (high-level categories)

**Effective date**: January 1, 2026

**Why it matters**: This law addresses growing concerns about AI training data—especially issues of copyright (AI trained on copyrighted books and art) and privacy (AI trained on personal data scraped from the internet).

**Example compliance**: An AI image generator would need to disclose that it was trained on "publicly available images from the internet, including stock photo databases and social media platforms, which may include copyrighted materials and images of identifiable individuals."

### SB 942: California AI Transparency Act (2024)

**What it does**: Requires AI systems to disclose their AI nature in certain contexts and provide detection tools for AI-generated content.

**Key provisions**:

1. **Provenance disclosure**: Generative AI providers must offer tools to detect AI-generated content
2. **Manifest/metadata requirements**: AI-generated images, audio, and video must include manifest information indicating they are AI-generated
3. **Disclosure requirements**: AI providers must provide clear, accessible disclosures about their systems

**Who it applies to**: Generative AI providers making services available in California

**Effective date**: Various provisions phased from 2025-2026

### Bot Disclosure Laws

California has multiple laws requiring disclosure when bots interact with people:

**SB 1001 (2018)**: The original "bot disclosure law"
- Prohibits using bots to interact with California residents without disclosure
- Applies when bots: (a) communicate online with intent to mislead, AND (b) to influence a commercial transaction or voting

**AB 587 (2022)**: Social media transparency
- Requires social media platforms to disclose policies on bots
- Mandates reporting on bot removal

**Key principle**: If a bot is designed to deceive people into thinking they're talking to a human, it must disclose its artificial nature.

**Example**: A customer service chatbot must disclose: "You are chatting with an automated assistant."

---


### Deepfake Regulations

California has been aggressive in regulating AI-generated fake media:

**AB 730 (2019)**: Election deepfakes
- Prohibits distributing deepfakes of political candidates within 60 days of an election
- Aims to prevent AI-generated election misinformation

**AB 602 (2019)**: Non-consensual deepfake pornography
- Creates civil liability for creating deepfake pornography without consent
- Allows victims to sue for damages

**AB 1836 (2024)**: Deceased individuals
- Protects the digital likeness of deceased people
- Requires consent from estates for AI-generated representations

**AB 2602 (2024)**: Digital replicas
- Requires consent for AI-generated digital replicas of performers
- Addresses concerns about AI replacing actors/musicians

**Why it matters**: These laws recognize that AI can create convincing fake content that harms individuals and society. California is establishing that generating someone's likeness without consent—living or dead—can carry legal consequences.

### SB 1047: The AI Safety Bill (Vetoed but Influential)

Perhaps the most controversial California AI proposal, SB 1047 would have imposed safety requirements on large AI models.

**What it proposed**:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-sb-1047-the-ai-safety-bill-vetoed-but-influential -->
1. **Safety testing**: Developers of large AI models (over $100M in training compute) must test for dangerous capabilities
2. **Kill switch**: Ability to rapidly shut down models
3. **Third-party audits**: Independent safety assessments
4. **Whistleblower protections**: For employees reporting safety concerns
5. **Government oversight**: New regulatory authority

**Why Governor Newsom vetoed it**: In September 2024, Governor Newsom vetoed SB 1047, arguing that:
- It focused too much on model size rather than actual risk
- The regulatory approach was premature
- It could stifle innovation
- Federal action might be more appropriate

**Why it still matters**: Despite the veto, SB 1047 advanced national conversations about AI safety and influenced other jurisdictions. Key concepts from the bill will likely resurface in future legislation.

### Employment and Hiring AI

California has several regulations affecting AI in employment:

**FEHA and AI**: The California Fair Employment and Housing Act applies to AI-enabled discrimination. If an AI hiring tool has discriminatory effects, employers face liability.

**CCPA/CPRA and automated decision-making**: The California Privacy Rights Act includes:
- Right to know about automated decision-making
- Right to opt out of certain automated processing
- Right to access information about logic involved in decisions

**Proposed regulations**: The California Civil Rights Department has proposed rules specifically addressing AI in employment, though these remain in development.

---


### Children and AI

California has enacted protections for minors interacting with AI:

**California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act (AADC)**:
- Requires businesses to consider children's best interests when designing services likely to be accessed by children
- Applies to AI features in apps and websites
- Requires data protection impact assessments

**Social media and AI**: Various laws address AI-driven content recommendation to minors

## Conclusion

California's approach to AI regulation reflects both its role as the nation's tech capital and its progressive regulatory tradition. While the state hasn't passed a single comprehensive AI law, its collection of targeted measures creates substantial compliance obligations for businesses serving California residents.

Key takeaways for business leaders:

<!-- component:flowchart:flowchart-conclusion -->
1. **Multiple laws apply**: You may face requirements from several California AI statutes simultaneously
2. **Transparency is a theme**: Disclosure about AI use, training data, and decision-making is consistently required
3. **Specific harms are addressed**: Deepfakes, discrimination, children's safety—California targets particular problems
4. **The landscape is evolving**: Stay current on new legislation and agency rules
5. **California often leads**: What happens in California frequently becomes national practice

For AI governance professionals, California offers both challenges and opportunities. The compliance burden is real, but so is the clarity that comes from specific legal requirements. Companies that build robust AI governance programs aligned with California standards will be well-positioned for whatever regulatory developments come next.

As one AI executive put it: "Ignore California at your peril. What starts in Sacramento has a way of ending up everywhere."

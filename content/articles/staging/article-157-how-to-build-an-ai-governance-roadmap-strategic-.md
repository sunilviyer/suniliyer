## Main Content


### Section 1: Why an EU-Level Framework?

* **Key points to cover:**
   * Avoid legal uncertainties for operators developing AI systems
   * Prevent fragmentation of the internal market due to divergent national approaches
   * Ensure free market movement, innovation, deployment, and uptake of AI systems
   * Maintain compliance with GDPR regarding the "black box" functioning of AI systems
   * Establish accountability and penalties for non-compliance
   * Create an interoperable framework that works across various fields
   * Build human-centric, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI systems

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * Without harmonized rules, a company operating in France, Germany, and Italy could face three different sets of AI requirements
   * The regulation protects rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including health, safety, democracy, rule of law, and environment

* **Practical implications:**
   * Organizations can now plan AI development with regulatory certainty across all EU member states
   * The framework prioritizes innovation while ensuring fundamental protections remain intact

### Section 2: Does This Apply to You?

* **Key points to cover:**
   * The regulations apply to AI actors: developers, organizations using AI to serve customers, and users of AI systems
   * **You ARE covered if:**
     * You use data from EU member countries
     * Your systems would be used in the EU
     * You plan to expand and envision entering the EU market
     * You want your AI systems to be compliant with stricter regulations upfront
   * **You ARE exempted if:**
     * Your systems are used for military and defence purposes
     * Primary application is research

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * A Canadian company using EU customer data for AI training falls under the Act
   * A US-based SaaS company with EU customers must comply
   * A university research lab developing experimental AI may be exempt

* **Practical implications:**
   * The extraterritorial reach means many non-EU organizations will need to comply
   * Organizations should assess their data sources and deployment footprint now
   * **Compliance deadline: June 12, 2026**

### Section 3: Penalties and Enforcement

* **Key points to cover:**
   * Member States establish rules for penalties and enforcement measures
   * Penalties must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive
   * Special consideration for interests of SMEs (small and medium enterprises)
   * **Penalty tiers:**
     * Non-compliance with prohibited AI practices: up to €35M or 7% of annual global turnover
     * Providing incorrect information: up to €7.5M or 1% of annual turnover
     * Other violations by operators: up to €15M or 3% of annual turnover

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * For a company with €1 billion in annual revenue, the maximum fine for prohibited practices could reach €70 million (7%)
   * Compare to GDPR's maximum of 4% of global turnover—the EU AI Act penalties are even steeper for the most serious violations

* **Practical implications:**
   * These penalties make non-compliance a serious financial risk
   * Organizations should begin compliance assessments well before the 2026 deadline
   * SMEs have some consideration built into the penalty structure

### Section 4: A Living Framework

* **Key points to cover:**
   * The Act is designed to evolve with AI advancements
   * The Commission has power to amend regulations based on developments
   * Regular evaluation and reporting cycles are built into the framework
   * **Review schedule:**
     * Regular evaluations of fines, enforcement, and need for amendments
     * Regular assessment of AI Office efficiency and need for upgrades
     * Regular evaluation of AI model development with proposed amendments
     * Three-year review of voluntary codes of conduct impact
     * Seven-year enforcement assessment with potential amendments

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * The rise of generative AI (ChatGPT, etc.) after initial drafting led to additions for General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems
   * This adaptive approach contrasts with more static regulatory frameworks

* **Practical implications:**
   * Organizations should monitor Commission updates and amendments
   * Compliance is not a one-time effort—ongoing attention is required
   * The framework acknowledges that AI governance must evolve with technology

### Section 5: Key Differences and Additional Considerations

* **Key points to cover:**
   * **EU AI Act vs. NIST Framework:** The EU AI Act includes policing and law enforcement, which are generally exempted from other frameworks
   * Biometric analysis restrictions: Differentiation based on race, gender, and sex for law enforcement purposes is addressed
   * Different application rules for General Purpose AI vs. High-Risk systems
   * Establishment of competent authorities like "Eurodac" for counter-terrorism and information sharing
   * AI Office development to build Union expertise in AI
   * EuroHPC Joint Undertaking supports Commission's development of expertise

* **Examples or case studies:**
   * Law enforcement use of facial recognition technology faces specific restrictions under the EU AI Act
   * High-risk systems (hiring, credit scoring, law enforcement) face stricter requirements than general-purpose systems

* **Practical implications:**
   * Organizations in law enforcement, border control, or public safety sectors face additional scrutiny
   * Understanding the risk classification of your AI systems is essential for compliance planning

## Conclusion

The EU AI Act represents a watershed moment in AI governance. For the first time, we have a comprehensive, legally binding framework that applies across an entire economic region—and due to its extraterritorial reach, affects organizations worldwide.

The key takeaways: know whether your organization falls under the Act's scope, understand the June 2026 compliance deadline, recognize the significant penalties for non-compliance, and appreciate that this is a living framework designed to evolve.

**Next steps:** Determine if your organization uses EU data or serves EU markets. Begin inventorying your AI systems and assessing their risk classifications. Stay informed on Commission updates as the framework continues to develop.

## The Birth of a Profession


### Why AI Auditing Is Becoming a Profession

Several forces are driving the professionalization of AI auditing:

**Regulatory Requirements**

| Regulation | AI Audit Requirement |
<!-- component:table:table-why-ai-auditing-is-becoming-a-profession -->
|------------|---------------------|
| EU AI Act | Conformity assessments for high-risk AI |
| NYC Local Law 144 | Annual bias audits for hiring AI |
| Banking regulations (SR 11-7) | Independent model validation |
| Proposed federal legislation | Various audit and assessment requirements |

**Market Demand**

- Organizations need to demonstrate AI trustworthiness
- Investors want AI governance assurance
- Customers demand fairness verification
- Insurance companies require risk assessments

**Complexity Growth**

AI systems are becoming more complex, more consequential, and more numerous. The expertise needed to audit them is increasingly specialized.

<!-- component:template:template-the-current-state-a-profession-in-formation -->

### The Current State: A Profession in Formation

Unlike accounting (which has century-old standards) or cybersecurity (which has decades of development), AI auditing is still forming:

| Aspect | Current State |
<!-- component:table:table-the-current-state-a-profession-in-formation -->
|--------|--------------|
| Standards | Emerging (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001) but not universal |
| Certifications | New and evolving (AIGP launched 2024) |
| Training programs | Limited; mostly self-directed learning |
| Professional associations | Forming; IAPP, ISACA expanding into AI |
| Career paths | Not yet standardized |
| Salary benchmarks | Variable; limited market data |

This means opportunity—early entrants can shape the profession—but also uncertainty.

## Core Competencies for AI Auditors


### The Three Pillars of AI Audit Expertise

Effective AI auditors need competency in three areas:

**Pillar 1: Audit Fundamentals**

Traditional audit skills remain essential:

| Skill | Why It Matters |
<!-- component:table:table-the-three-pillars-of-ai-audit-expertise -->
|-------|---------------|
| Risk assessment | Prioritizing what to examine |
| Evidence gathering | Collecting and evaluating proof |
| Interviewing | Extracting information from stakeholders |
| Documentation review | Analyzing policies and records |
| Report writing | Communicating findings clearly |
| Professional skepticism | Questioning assumptions appropriately |
| Independence | Maintaining objectivity |

**Pillar 2: AI/ML Knowledge**

Understanding how AI systems work:

| Knowledge Area | What to Understand |
<!-- component:table:table-the-three-pillars-of-ai-audit-expertise -->
|----------------|-------------------|
| ML fundamentals | How models learn, types of algorithms |
| Model evaluation | Performance metrics, validation approaches |
| Bias and fairness | How discrimination manifests in AI |
| Data quality | What makes data suitable for AI |
| AI limitations | Where AI fails, why explanations matter |
| AI lifecycle | From development through deployment |

You don't need to be a data scientist, but you need enough knowledge to:
- Understand what developers are telling you
- Identify red flags in technical documentation
- Interpret testing results
- Ask informed questions

**Pillar 3: Governance and Ethics**

Understanding the broader context:

| Area | What to Know |
<!-- component:table:table-the-three-pillars-of-ai-audit-expertise -->
|------|-------------|
| AI regulations | EU AI Act, GDPR, sector-specific rules |
| Ethics frameworks | OECD principles, IEEE standards |
| Risk management | NIST AI RMF, ISO 31000 |
| Corporate governance | Board oversight, committee structures |
| Stakeholder interests | Who's affected and how |
| Human rights | Fundamental rights implications |


### The T-Shaped Professional

The most effective AI auditors are "T-shaped"—broad knowledge across all three pillars, with deep expertise in one area:

```
    Broad Knowledge
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    │ Audit │   AI/ML    │ Governance │
    │Basics │  Knowledge │  & Ethics  │
    ──────────────────────────────────────
             │
             │ Deep
             │ Expertise
             │ (pick one)
             │
             ▼
```

**Example Profiles:**

| Background | Broad In | Deep In |
<!-- component:table:table-the-t-shaped-professional -->
|------------|----------|---------|
| Former data scientist | AI/ML | Learning audit + governance |
| Internal auditor | Audit | Learning AI + governance |
| Privacy professional | Governance | Learning AI + audit |
| Compliance lawyer | Governance | Learning AI + audit |

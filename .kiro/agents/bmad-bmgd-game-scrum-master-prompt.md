2. **sprint-planning**: Generate or update sprint-status.yaml from epic files (Required after GDD+Epics are created)
3. **sprint-status**: View sprint progress, surface risks, and get next action recommendation
4. **create-story**: Create Story with direct ready-for-dev marking (Required to prepare stories for development)
5. **validate-create-story**: Validate Story Draft with Independent Review (Highly Recommended)
6. **epic-retrospective**: Facilitate team retrospective after a game development epic is completed
7. **correct-course**: Navigate significant changes during game dev sprint (When implementation is off-track)

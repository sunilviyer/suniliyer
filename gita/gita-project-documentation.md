## 1. Project Overview

### Vision
A visual journey through the Bhagavad Gita, presenting its wisdom through 10 pivotal moments. The experience transforms from darkness to light—mirroring Arjuna's journey from despair to illumination.

### Core Principles
- **Content is king** — The verses, translations, and interpretations are the heart
- **Visual as atmosphere** — Art and animation create mood, not distraction
- **Layered depth** — Surface beauty for casual visitors, deep meaning for seekers
- **Single page experience** — All 10 moments accessible without navigation fatigue

### What This Is NOT
- Not a complete translation of all 18 chapters
- Not an academic commentary
- Not a religious instruction manual
- Not a linear chapter-by-chapter walkthrough

### Target Audience
- People curious about the Gita but intimidated by its length
- Those seeking practical wisdom, not religious doctrine
- Design/art appreciators who will be drawn by the visuals
- Portfolio visitors who want to see thoughtful, meaningful work

---

## 2. Content Architecture

### Structure: "Moments, Not Chapters"

Instead of 18 chapters, we curate **10 pivotal moments**. Each moment is a self-contained micro-experience that can stand alone or connect to the whole.

### Why 10 Moments?

| Consideration | Reasoning |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Comprehensiveness** | Covers all major paths (Karma, Jnana, Bhakti, Dhyana) |
| **Production feasibility** | Each needs art, animation, layered content |
| **Visitor attention** | Digestible without overwhelming |
| **Narrative arc** | Complete journey from crisis to resolution |

### Content Layers (Per Moment)

Each moment unfolds in 4 layers:

| Layer | Content | Tone |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Layer 0** | Visual + Sanskrit (Devanagari) + Transliteration | Sacred, atmospheric |
| **Layer 1** | English translation + brief context | Clear, accessible |
| **Layer 2** | The inner/psychological meaning | Contemplative |
| **Layer 3** | Practical application ("For You, Today") | Conversational, direct |

### Content Sources

| Element | Source Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Sanskrit (Devanagari)** | Standard texts |
| **Transliteration** | IAST standard |
| **English Translation** | Curate from Easwaran, Gita Press, or Bibek Debroy — pick ONE for consistency |
| **Layer 2-3 Discussion** | Original writing in Sunil's voice |

### Moment 1: Arjuna's Collapse

**Chapter:** 1-2

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
न योत्स्य इति गोविन्दम् उक्त्वा तूष्णीं बभूव ह
```

**Transliteration:**
```
na yotsya iti govindam uktvā tūṣṇīṁ babhūva ha
```

**Translation:**
"I shall not fight," said Arjuna to Krishna, and became silent.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Arjuna, the mighty warrior, sees his teachers, uncles, and cousins on the opposing side. His bow slips from his hands. He cannot act.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
This is the universal moment of paralysis — when duty conflicts with love, when action seems impossible, when we face choices that have no clean answers.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
Have you ever been frozen by a decision where every option felt wrong? This is where the teaching begins.

**Visual Direction:**
View from behind Arjuna and Krishna in their chariot, gazing at the vast battlefield. Millions of warriors stretching to the horizon. Elephants, horses, infantry—some larger in foreground for scale, most tiny like scattered seeds. Dust, low sun, long shadows. Isolation amid multitude.

---

### Moment 2: The Eternal Self

**Chapter:** 2.12

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः
```

**Transliteration:**
```
na tvevāhaṁ jātu nāsaṁ na tvaṁ neme janādhipāḥ
```

**Translation:**
Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings; nor shall we ever cease to be.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Krishna's first revelation: You are not the body. What you truly are was never born and will never die.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
The foundation of all that follows. If you understand this one truth, everything changes. Fear of death dissolves. Fear of loss softens.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
What remains constant in you, despite all the changes you've been through? That unchanging witness — that is what Krishna points to.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 3: The Steady One (Sthitaprajna)

**Chapter:** 2.54-72

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव
```

**Transliteration:**
```
sthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā samādhi-sthasya keśava
```

**Translation:**
What are the signs of one whose wisdom is steady? How do they speak, sit, walk?

**Context (Layer 1):**
Arjuna asks a practical question: What does an enlightened person actually look like in daily life?

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
Krishna describes a person unmoved by pleasure or pain, without craving or aversion, fully present. Not detached from life, but unshaken by its waves.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
This is your north star. Not a distant god, but a way of being. How would you act today if you were unshaken?

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 4: Action Without Attachment

**Chapter:** 2.47

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन
```

**Transliteration:**
```
karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana
```

**Translation:**
You have the right to action alone, never to its fruits.

**Context (Layer 1):**
The most quoted verse. Often misunderstood as "don't care about results." It's deeper than that.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
Act fully, skillfully, with complete dedication — but release your grip on outcomes. The anxiety isn't in the action, it's in the clinging to results.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
What would you do differently today if you focused entirely on the quality of your effort, not the reward?

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 5: The Restless Mind

**Chapter:** 6.34-35

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद् दृढम्
```

**Transliteration:**
```
cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham
```

**Translation:**
The mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, obstinate. I think it is as hard to control as the wind.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Arjuna voices what every meditator feels. Krishna doesn't dismiss it — he agrees, and offers the way.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
By practice and dispassion, the mind can be stilled. Not by force, but by patient, repeated return. The wind can be worked with.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
Your mind will wander ten thousand times. The practice is simply: notice, and return. That's it. That's the whole path.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 6: Devotion

**Chapter:** 9.29

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रियः
```

**Transliteration:**
```
samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ
```

**Translation:**
I am the same to all beings. None is hateful to me, none dear. But those who worship me with devotion — they are in me, and I am in them.

**Context (Layer 1):**
The path of the heart. Not everyone reaches truth through analysis. Some arrive through love.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
The divine doesn't play favorites — but those who turn toward it find themselves held. This is not transaction. It's relationship.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
What do you love so completely that you lose yourself in it? That dissolution of self — that's the door.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 7: At the Moment of Death

**Chapter:** 8.5-6

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्
```

**Transliteration:**
```
anta-kāle ca mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram
```

**Translation:**
Whoever, at the time of death, leaves the body remembering Me alone, attains My being. Of this there is no doubt.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Arjuna asks directly: What happens when we die? Krishna answers: The final thought shapes what follows.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
This isn't about a deathbed prayer. It's about what you practice becoming. What you remember in crisis is what you've cultivated in peace.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
If your life ended today, what would your mind naturally turn to? That reveals where your practice truly is.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 8: The Cosmic Form (Vishwaroop)

**Chapter:** 11

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
पश्यादित्यान्वसून्रुद्रानश्विनौ मरुतस्तथा
```

**Transliteration:**
```
paśyādityān vasūn rudrān aśvinau marutas tathā
```

**Translation:**
Behold the Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, the twin Ashvins, and the Maruts. Behold, Arjuna, wonders never seen before.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Arjuna asks to see Krishna's true form. He is granted divine sight. What he sees terrifies him.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
The infinite cannot be domesticated. When Arjuna glimpses totality — creation and destruction, all beings entering and exiting — he trembles and begs for the familiar form back.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
Sometimes growth means encountering what is too vast to hold. The awe. The terror. The mystery that doesn't fit in your categories.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 9: The Three Gunas

**Chapter:** 14

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणाः प्रकृतिसम्भवाः
```

**Transliteration:**
```
sattvaṁ rajas tama iti guṇāḥ prakṛti-sambhavāḥ
```

**Translation:**
Sattva, Rajas, Tamas — these three qualities born of nature bind the imperishable soul to the body.

**Context (Layer 1):**
Krishna gives Arjuna a framework for understanding his own mind: clarity (sattva), agitation (rajas), inertia (tamas).

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
You are not your moods. These are patterns of energy that move through you. See them, name them, and you begin to be free of their grip.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
Right now — are you clear and calm? Restless and driven? Heavy and stuck? Just noticing is the first step.

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

---

### Moment 10: Surrender

**Chapter:** 18.66

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज
```

**Transliteration:**
```
sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
```

**Translation:**
Abandoning all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I shall free you from all sins. Do not grieve.

**Context (Layer 1):**
The final teaching. After 18 chapters of paths and practices, Krishna offers the simplest instruction: Let go. Trust. Come to Me.

**Inner Meaning (Layer 2):**
This isn't abandoning ethics. It's releasing the ego's grip on being the doer. After all the effort — surrender the effort itself.

**For You, Today (Layer 3):**
What are you still trying to control? What would it feel like to set that down, just for a moment?

**Visual Direction:**
[To be developed]

## 4. Visual Design System

### Color Palette: From Darkness to Light

The palette tells the story of transformation. Colors progress from deep darkness (despair) to warm amber (illumination).

| Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Ink Black** | `#03071E` | 3, 7, 30 | Primary background, the void |
| **Night Bordeaux** | `#370617` | 55, 6, 23 | Deep accents, early moments |
| **Black Cherry** | `#6A040F` | 106, 4, 15 | Moment 3 accent |
| **Oxblood** | `#9D0208` | 157, 2, 8 | Moment 4 accent |
| **Brick Ember** | `#D00000` | 208, 0, 0 | Moment 5 accent |
| **Red Ochre** | `#DC2F02` | 220, 47, 2 | Moment 6 accent |
| **Autumn Leaf** | `#E85D04` | 232, 93, 4 | Moment 7 accent |
| **Dark Orange** | `#F48C06` | 244, 140, 6 | Moment 8 accent |
| **Orange** | `#FAA307` | 250, 163, 7 | Moment 9 accent |
| **Amber Flame** | `#FFBA08` | 255, 186, 8 | Primary highlight, Sanskrit text, final moment |

### Color Application

| Element | Color(s) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Background (default) | Ink Black | Full bleed |
| Background (per moment) | Shifts with selection | Radial gradient from accent color |
| Sanskrit verses | Amber Flame | Glowing, sacred |
| Transliteration | Orange | Secondary sacred |
| English translation | White (#FFFFFF) | Clean, readable |
| Body text (layers) | Light gray (#CCCCCC) | Softer, contemplative |
| UI labels | Khand font, Orange/Amber | Crisp, modern |
| Hover states | Accent → brighter | Warmth rising |

### Art Style Direction

**Primary Influence:** Traditional Indian miniature painting (Rajput, Pahari, Mughal)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Minimalist composition — clean negative space
- Limited color palette within each image
- Muted earth tones with gold accents
- Simplified but recognizable forms
- Flat perspective (traditional, not Western realism)
- Contemplative mood, not action-oriented

**What to Avoid:**
- Photorealistic rendering
- Western fantasy art styles
- Overly busy compositions
- Bright, saturated modern colors
- Generic "AI art" aesthetic

## 6. UX & Interaction Design

### Core Concept: Two Distinct Modes

The interface has two clean modes that never overlap. Navigate OR read — not both at once.

| Mode | Purpose | What's Visible |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Navigation** | Choose a moment | Chakra, master image, footer |
| **Reading** | Experience a moment | Content, scene image, position dots, close button, footer |

This separation ensures:
- The chakra isn't competing with content
- Images get full visual attention
- Clear mental model for the user
- Same logic scales across all devices

---

**Elements:**
- **Header:** Position dots (● ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○) + close button [✕]
- **Background:** Scene image — specific to the selected moment
- **Content card:** Progressive layers of content
- **Layer indicator:** Small dots showing depth (4 layers total)

### Transition Animations

**Navigation → Reading (on node click):**

| Step | Animation | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Spokes retract toward nodes | 200ms |
| 2 | Nodes fade out (selected node fades last) | 300ms |
| 3 | Ring fades out | 200ms |
| 4 | Master image crossfades to scene image | 600ms |
| 5 | Content card rises up | 400ms |
| 6 | Position dots + close button fade in | 200ms |

**Reading → Navigation (on close click):**

| Step | Animation | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Content card fades down | 300ms |
| 2 | Position dots + close button fade out | 200ms |
| 3 | Scene image crossfades to master image | 600ms |
| 4 | Ring fades in | 200ms |
| 5 | Nodes fade in | 300ms |
| 6 | Spokes extend from center | 200ms |
| 7 | Orbiting pulse resumes | immediate |

The chakra's entrance/exit should feel organic — like it's breathing in and out of existence.

### Progressive Content Layers

Each moment has 4 layers, revealed one at a time:

| Layer | Content | Button Text |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 0 (default) | Title, Chapter, Sanskrit, Transliteration, Translation | "Reveal the Scene →" |
| 1 | The Scene (context) | "Go Deeper →" |
| 2 | The Inner Meaning | "For You Today →" |
| 3 | For You, Today (practical application) | — (fully revealed) |

- ॐ character: Tiro Devanagari Hindi, 1.8rem, Amber Flame
- Subtle box shadow glow

---

### Position Dots (Reading Mode Header)

**Purpose:** Show which moment is selected (1-10). Display only, not interactive.

- Selected: ● (filled, Amber Flame)
- Unselected: ○ (outline only, 40% opacity)
- Size: 6px diameter
- Spacing: 8px gap
- Position: Top left of screen

---

**Design:**
- Character: ✕
- Font: Khand, 500 weight
- Size: 24px
- Color: Orange, 70% opacity → 100% on hover
- Position: Top right of screen
- Hover: subtle glow

---

### Footer: Framing Verse (4.7-8)

The footer is the constant anchor — present in both modes. It frames the entire experience with Krishna's promise.

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
```
यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत।
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्॥

परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम्।
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे॥
```

**Transliteration:**
```
yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata
abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham

paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge
```

**Translation:**
"Whenever dharma declines and adharma rises, O Bharata, I manifest myself. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of dharma — I appear in every age."

**Design:**
- Background: rgba(3, 7, 30, 0.5) with top border
- Devanagari: Tiro Devanagari Hindi, Amber Flame, 0.95rem
- Transliteration: Laila italic, Orange, 0.65rem, 70% opacity
- Translation: Laila, #999, 0.6rem, 60% opacity
- Padding: 18px
- Always visible, never changes between modes

### Responsive Design

**The same two-mode concept scales across all devices.** The chakra is always circular — it just gets proportionally smaller.

| Viewport | Chakra Radius | Content Width | Adjustments |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Desktop (>1024px) | 175-210px | 340px | Full experience |
| Tablet (768-1024px) | 140-170px | 300px | Slightly tighter spacing |
| Mobile (<768px) | 100-130px | 90% of screen | Nodes smaller (32px), footer text smaller |

**Key principle:** One concept, proportionally scaled. No separate "mobile layout."

**Mobile-specific adjustments:**
- Node size: 32px default, 38px selected
- Node labels: Hidden (numbers only)
- Content card: Wider (90% of screen), more padding
- Footer: Condensed (shorter verse display if needed)
- Orbiting pulse: Slightly smaller (10px outer glow)

## 7. Visual Production

### Finalized Art Direction

**Style:** Abstract watercolor, wet-on-wet technique, contemporary Indian art influence

**Key Characteristics:**
- Figures dissolving at edges, not sharply defined
- Watercolor bleeding and pooling into handmade paper texture
- Emotional weight conveyed through form, not detail
- Vast negative space (cream/off-white paper)
- Minimalist — only essential elements

**Color Palette:**
- Earth tones: burnt sienna, ochre, amber, brown
- Blue: indigo, cerulean (for Krishna)
- Gold/amber for divine radiance
- Cream paper as background

**What Works:**
- Abstract suggestion of figures
- Emotional posture over anatomical accuracy  
- Watercolor bleeds conveying feeling (grief drips down, radiance spreads out)
- Small human figures for scale against the vast/divine

**What to Avoid:**
- Multiple arms/eyes (cliché)
- Horror or terror imagery
- Overly literal depictions
- Busy compositions
- Sharp, defined edges

### Midjourney Settings

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Version | 6.1 | Latest, best quality |
| Aspect Ratio | 16:9 | Matches background display |
| Style | --style raw | Less "Midjourney polish," more authentic |
| Stylize | --s 250 (default) | Balanced |

### Style Consistency Strategy

1. Use `--sref [URL]` referencing Moment 1 or Moment 8 images
2. Maintain consistent prompt structure across all moments
3. Keep the watercolor/wet-on-wet/handmade paper language in every prompt
4. Adjust emotional direction per moment while preserving technique

### Animation Guidelines (NanoBanana)

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Subtle watercolor bleeding | Fast action |
| Gentle color diffusion | Camera movement |
| Soft breathing of forms | Character movement |
| Paper texture subtle motion | Dramatic effects |

**Loop Duration:** 8 seconds maximum  
**Loop Style:** Seamless, no visible cut point

## 8. Midjourney Prompts

### Base Style Language

All prompts use this core approach:
```
watercolor bleeding into handmade paper, wet on wet technique, Indian contemporary art, minimalist, [emotional descriptor] --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

---

### Master Image (Navigation Mode Background)

**Concept:** Arjuna kneeling in despair, Krishna standing behind as guide, army in the distance. The full context before the teaching begins.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract kneeling figure with bow on ground, tall guardian figure rising behind, army suggested as hundreds of small watercolor marks bleeding into the horizon, wet on wet technique, earth tones and amber on cream paper, Indian contemporary art, minimalist, the weight of what must be faced --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

---

### Moment 1: Arjuna's Collapse

**Concept:** A warrior who cannot fight. Dissolving downward in grief.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract figure dissolving downward, suggestion of a warrior kneeling, bow resting on ground, watercolor bleeding and pooling into handmade paper, wet on wet technique, earth tones amber and burnt sienna, Indian contemporary art, minimalist, heavy with grief --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Figure dissolves downward (gravity of despair)
- Bow visible but abandoned
- Drips pulling toward earth
- Vast negative space = isolation

---

### Moment 2: The Eternal Self

**Concept:** The Self that cannot be touched — weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract golden human silhouette at center perfectly still, fire water wind earth swirling around but not touching, watercolor elements in chaos around luminous form, wet on wet technique, Indian contemporary art, the witness untouched --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Golden figure at center, simple and still
- White halo of space protecting the center
- Fire, water, wind raging around but not reaching
- The Self as untouchable witness

---

### Moment 3: The Steady One

**Concept:** Unmoved, rooted, steady wisdom. Still water reflecting perfectly.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract seated figure reflected in still water below, perfect mirror image, calm and undisturbed surface, earth tones and amber with soft reflection, wet on wet watercolor, handmade paper, Indian contemporary art, unshaken by waves --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Warrior at rest, not collapsed, not fighting
- Perfect reflection = inner and outer aligned
- Still water = mind at peace
- Vast negative space

---

### Moment 4: Action Without Attachment

**Concept:** Full effort, complete release. The right to action, not to fruits.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract archer releasing arrow, full draw to release, watercolor showing motion and letting go, earth tones and amber, arrow flying free, wet on wet technique on handmade paper, Indian contemporary art, act fully then release --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- The moment of release, not aiming
- Motion in the arrow, stillness in the archer
- Effort without clinging

---

### Moment 5: The Restless Mind

**Concept:** Turbulent, scattered, as hard to control as the wind.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract figure fragmenting into many small watercolor marks, pieces of self scattered across cream paper, not violent but unsettled, earth tones and amber in motion, wet on wet technique, Indian contemporary art, the mind that will not rest --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Figure barely holding together
- Splinters of thought flying in all directions
- Chaotic but not violent — unsettled
- Turbulence made visible

---

### Moment 6: Devotion

**Concept:** The path of the heart. They are in me, and I am in them.

**Prompt:**
```
Small figure with arms gently raised, reaching toward a soft blue Krishna figure with flute above, watercolor bleeding upward from earth tones into indigo and gold, colors merging where they meet, wet on wet technique, handmade paper, Indian contemporary art, devotion as longing --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Devotee reaching toward Krishna
- Blue and gold bleeding together
- The space between them already merging
- Warmth and longing

---

### Moment 7: At the Moment of Death

**Concept:** Not ending but becoming. The final thought shapes what follows.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract figure with a translucent golden form rising gently upward from it, two versions of the same being, earth tones below and soft amber light above, watercolor bleeding upward, wet on wet technique, Indian contemporary art, what continues --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Golden form rising from earthbound body
- Light emerging, not darkness
- Continuation, not ending
- What you practice, you become

---

### Moment 8: The Cosmic Form (Vishwaroop)

**Concept:** Krishna reveals his true nature — not terror, but overwhelming beauty and radiance. Pure awe.

**Prompt:**
```
Towering blue figure with peacock feather crown playing flute, small figure kneeling below with hands raised in reverence, blue watercolor dissolving into amber and gold at edges, wet on wet technique, handmade paper texture, Indian contemporary art, divine form revealed, overwhelming beauty --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Blue = Krishna (always)
- Peacock feather + flute = iconic recognition
- Gold/amber bleeding from the form = radiance
- Arjuna looking UP (awe, not terror)
- Form dissolving at edges = infinite but still human

---

### Moment 9: The Three Gunas

**Concept:** Sattva (clarity), Rajas (agitation), Tamas (inertia). Three energies that move through us.

**Prompt:**
```
Single seated figure in meditation, three shadows or energies extending from it in different directions, one rising upward in pale gold, one spreading sideways in restless orange, one sinking down in heavy brown, watercolor bleeding into handmade paper, wet on wet technique, Indian contemporary art, the energies within --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Seated figure as anchor
- Three distinct colors/directions for three gunas
- Gold rising (sattva), orange spreading (rajas), brown sinking (tamas)
- You are not your moods — you can see them

---

### Moment 10: Surrender

**Concept:** Letting go. Not collapse, not defeat — release. Peace.

**Prompt:**
```
Abstract figure seated with hands open, palms up, releasing, bow resting gently across lap, watercolor softly bleeding outward from open palms, earth tones dissolving into soft gold and white, wet on wet technique on handmade paper, Indian contemporary art, minimalist, letting go --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --style raw
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Seated, still — not collapsed like Moment 1
- Palms open = releasing
- Bow in lap = warrior identity at rest, no longer needed
- Soft gold = peace, not grief

---

Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed.Every morning a lion wakes up.It knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death.It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle.When the sun comes up, you better start running .- Thomas L. Friedman

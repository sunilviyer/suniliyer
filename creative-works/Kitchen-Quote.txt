I wanna get a job naming kitchen appliance. Seems like the easiest job ever. You know, refrigerator, toaster, blender...you just say what the thing does and then you add '-er'. Kitchen Appliance Naming Institute. "What does this do?" "It keeps shit fresh." "Well, that's a 'fresher'. I'm going on break."- Mitch Hedberg

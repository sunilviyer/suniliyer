Impossible is just a big wordthrown around by small men,who find it easier to live in a worldgiven to them, than to explorethe power they have to change it.Impossible is not a fact, it’s an opinion.Impossible is not a declaration, it’s a dare.Impossible is potential.Impossible is temporary.Impossible is nothing.

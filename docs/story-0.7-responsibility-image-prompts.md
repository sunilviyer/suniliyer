## Production Workflow

### Step 1: Image Generation
1. Use Midjourney or DALL-E 3 to generate images using prompts above
2. Generate at 1920x1280 resolution (3:2 aspect ratio)
3. Ensure Dry Sage color palette dominance
4. Review for:
   - Color accuracy
   - Visual clarity
   - Professional aesthetic
   - Concept accuracy
   - WCAG AAA contrast when text overlays are added

### Step 2: Post-Processing
1. Color correction if needed (ensure #a4ac86 Dry Sage is dominant)
2. Crop/resize to exact 1920x1280 if needed
3. Save as JPG (quality 85)
4. File naming: Use exact slug from article metadata

### Step 3: WebP Conversion
```bash
# Convert all JPG to WebP
for file in /public/images/responsibility/*.jpg; do
  cwebp -q 85 "$file" -o "${file%.jpg}.webp"
done
```

### Step 4: Validation
1. Check all 20 images generated
2. Verify color palette consistency
3. Verify resolution (1920x1280)
4. Verify file sizes (<200KB for WebP)
5. Verify filenames match slugs exactly

### Step 5: Deployment
1. Place JPG files in `/public/images/responsibility/`
2. Place WebP files in `/public/images/responsibility/`
3. Update image manifest CSV
4. Mark Story 0.7 as complete

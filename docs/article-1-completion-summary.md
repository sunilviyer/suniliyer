## Component Links (To Be Implemented)

The article uses placeholder links that need to be implemented in the platform:

```markdown
{{LINK_EXAMPLE_dartmouth-conference}}
{{LINK_EXAMPLE_deep-blue}}
{{LINK_EXAMPLE_alphago}}
{{LINK_EXAMPLE_alexnet}}
{{LINK_EXAMPLE_chatgpt}}
{{LINK_TEMPLATE_transformer-timeline}}
{{LINK_terminology_ai-definition}}
{{LINK_terminology_deep-learning}}
{{LINK_responsibility_governance-frameworks}}
{{LINK_risk_ai-harms}}
{{LINK_future_regulation}}
```

These placeholders should be replaced with actual routing links when the Next.js platform is built.

## Duplicate Content Check

✅ **No duplicate content detected**

The article contains unique content not found in other articles:
- Specific dates and participants of Dartmouth Conference
- Detailed timeline of AI history
- Lighthill Report and AI Winters context
- Move 37 from AlphaGo match

## Next Steps

### For This Article
1. ✅ Article finalized and in `/final/` directory
2. ⏳ Generate or source 6 images
3. ⏳ Verify all cross-referenced articles exist (some may need to be created)
4. ⏳ Implement component links in platform code
5. ⏳ Schedule for 02/14/2025 publication

### For Next Article (Article 2)
1. Select appropriate article for 02/15/2025 launch
2. Criteria: Foundational article, complements AI History
3. Suggested: "The AI Family Tree: Understanding AI Intelligence Levels" or "Artificial Intelligence: Defining an Elusive Concept"
4. Process through same 20-component extraction
5. Estimated time: 45-60 minutes

## Lessons Learned

### Time Estimation
- Initial estimate: 15-20 minutes per article
- Actual time: 45-60 minutes per article
- Reason: Thoroughness of component extraction, examples/templates creation

### Component Extraction Insights
1. **Examples** - Often embedded in article body, need extraction to separate file
2. **Templates** - Component tags in original indicate reusable content
3. **Learning Path** - May be incorrectly assigned in V1, needs verification
4. **TL;DR** - V1 had generic descriptions, need article-specific rewrites
5. **Sources** - Most V1 articles lacked citations, need to add

### Efficiency Improvements for Next Articles
1. Create source templates for common citation types
2. Develop standard image naming and location conventions
3. Build library of cross-reference links as articles complete
4. Create reusable learning objective templates by article type

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

### Phase 1: Image Mapping ⚠️ **62.5% COMPLETE**
1. ✅ Reviewed existing images in `/images/future/` and `/images/responsibility/`
2. ✅ Copied/renamed 10 images to match article slugs
3. ❌ **REMAINING:** Create 6 missing images:
   - `/images/future/ai-existential-risk.webp`
   - `/images/future/ai-national-security.webp`
   - `/images/future/ai-safety.webp`
   - `/images/future/future-ai-ethics.webp`
   - `/images/future/trustworthy-ai.webp`
   - `/images/responsibility/nist-ai-rmf.webp`

### Phase 2: Content Creation
For each article, need to add:
1. Main article content (HTML with card markers)
2. TLDR (1-2 sentences)
3. Key Learnings (5 items)
4. Additional Resources (3+ items)
5. Sources (3+ items)

### Phase 3: SEO & Metadata
For each article:
1. Tags (4-5 relevant tags)
2. Read Time (e.g., "8 min read")
3. Updated Date (e.g., "2024-01-20")
4. Header Image path

### Phase 4: Resource Cards
1. Create resource cards for each article
2. Link cards to articles via used_in_articles array
3. Add download URLs and learn_more links

---

## 📊 EFFORT ESTIMATE

**Total Work Required:**
- 16 articles × (content + TLDR + 5 learnings + 3 resources + 3 sources)
- 16 header images to create/map
- 16 × SEO metadata (tags, read time, date)
- ~48 resource cards (avg 3 per article)

**Status:** These are future articles - placeholders only
**Priority:** Low (focus on completing the 24 published articles first)

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDATION

Keep these 16 articles in "not_started" status. They are placeholders for future content development. The current focus should be on:

1. ✅ Completing Phase 2 migration for the 24 published articles
2. Creating article pages at `/articles/{path}/{slug}`
3. Then return to content creation for these 16 articles

**Current Published Articles: 24**
**Future Articles (Placeholders): 16**
**Total Planned: 40 articles**

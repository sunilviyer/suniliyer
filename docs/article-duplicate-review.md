## Duplicate Review Findings

### No Obvious Duplicates Found
Quick review of article titles shows good topic distribution without obvious duplicates:
- Articles cover distinct phases: planning (79), business case (80), governance (82), design (83), data (84-86), development (87-99), deployment (96-97), operations (98-100)
- Clear progression from concept to implementation
- Each article has unique focus within its domain

### Articles Requiring Closer Review
Some articles may have overlapping content that needs careful handling:

**Governance Structure Articles**:
- Article 82: "AI Governance Structures: Roles, Responsibilities, and Accountability"
- Article 101: "Building the AI Governance Function: Where to Start"
- Article 102: "AI Governance Roles: CPO, CAO, and the Responsible AI Team"
- Article 103: "The AI Ethics Board: Structure, Charter, and Effectiveness"
- **Note**: These appear complementary (overview → implementation → specific roles → board focus)

**Risk & Assessment Articles**:
- Article 74: "Algorithmic Impact Assessments: A Step-by-Step Guide" (completed)
- Article 75: "AI Risk Assessment Templates: Tools for Practitioners" (completed)
- **Note**: Article 74 focuses on impact assessments, 75 on risk templates - complementary

**Testing Articles**:
- Article 92: "Testing AI Systems: Beyond Traditional Software QA"
- Article 93: "Bias Testing: Detecting Discrimination Before Deployment"
- Article 94: "Red Teaming AI: Adversarial Testing for Safety"
- **Note**: These cover different testing dimensions - general, fairness, security

**Third-Party Articles**:
- Article 106: "Third-Party AI Risk: Vendor Assessment and Management"
- Article 107: "AI Procurement: Contract Terms and Due Diligence"
- Article 88: "The Build vs. Buy Decision: When to Use Third-Party AI"
- **Note**: Complementary - decision making, risk assessment, contracting

### Recommendations

1. **Continue systematic processing** - No significant duplicates requiring article removal
2. **Ensure cross-referencing** - Related articles should reference each other
3. **Watch for content overlap** - When processing overlapping topics, ensure:
   - Different angles/perspectives
   - Clear differentiation in frontmatter descriptions
   - Cross-path references linking related content
4. **Quality over speed** - Maintain comprehensive frontmatter and content quality

## Next Steps
1. Review Articles 79-85 for content quality and differentiation
2. Continue systematic processing maintaining 100+ relatedConcepts per article
3. Update registries periodically as new examples/templates emerge
4. Track bidirectional links for knowledge graph construction

## Notes
- Publishing schedule: Monday/Friday pattern (next: 11/10, 11/14, 11/17, 11/21...)
- All articles follow comprehensive 20-component frontmatter structure
- Option 4 content structure maintained (inline examples + detailed case studies)

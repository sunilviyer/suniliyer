## Implementation Notes

### Image Generation Workflow
1. **Select Category:** Identify article category from frontmatter
2. **Choose Template:** Use category-specific prompt template
3. **Customize Elements:** Add article-specific visual elements
4. **Generate Master:** Create 1200x750px image with earth-tone palette
5. **Optimize:** Use Next.js Image component for optimization
6. **CSS Filters:** Apply filters for dark/light mode variants

### Color Pairing Guidelines
- **Primary + Secondary:** Use category color + complementary earth tone
- **Contrast:** Ensure visual hierarchy with lighter/darker combinations
- **Consistency:** Maintain earth-tone palette across all images
- **Accessibility:** Verify contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AAA standards

### File Naming Convention
```
[article-slug]-hero.png
Example: ai-accountability-who-is-responsible-when-ai-causes-harm-hero.png
```

### Storage Location
```
/public/images/articles/[article-slug]-hero.png
